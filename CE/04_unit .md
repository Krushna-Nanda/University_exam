#### **Critical Reading and Analysis**  
Understand the Purpose
When you read something, ask yourself: Why was it written? Is it trying to give information, explain something, or just entertain you? For example, a news article informs, while a story entertains.

Critical reading means thinking carefully about the text.
- **Understand the Purpose**: Why was this written? To inform, explain, or entertain?  
- **Facts and Opinions**: Know the difference. Facts are true, opinions are personal views.  
- **Ask Questions**: Think: What is the writer saying? Do I agree?  
- **Check Evidence**: Look for examples or proof to support the writerâ€™s ideas.
