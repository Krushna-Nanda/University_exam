### **Short Questions (SQ) Answers â€“ COA**  

#### **1. What is a Pipeline?**  
A **pipeline** is a technique where multiple instructions are processed in different stages simultaneously, like an assembly line. It increases CPU efficiency and speed.  

#### **2. What are Hazards in Pipelining?**  
Hazards are issues that **stall the pipeline** and reduce efficiency. They are of three types:  
- **Data Hazard** (dependency between instructions, e.g., RAW, WAR, WAW)  
- **Control Hazard** (caused by branch instructions)  
- **Structural Hazard** (hardware limitations, e.g., insufficient memory access)  

#### **3. How to Handle Hazards?**  
- **Data Forwarding** (bypassing)  
- **Stalling** (delaying execution)  
- **Branch Prediction** (guessing the next instruction)  

#### **4. What are RAW, WAR, and WAW?**  
These are **data hazards** in pipelines:  
WAW (Write After Write) â€“ Conflicting Writes
This occurs when two instructions try to write to the same register at the same time, causing data inconsistency.
WAR (Write After Read) â€“ Overwriting Issue
This happens when a later instruction tries to write to a register before an earlier instruction has finished reading from it.
RAW (Read After Write) â€“ Missing Data Issue
This occurs when an instruction tries to read a value before the previous instruction has written it. Since the required data isnâ€™t available yet, the pipeline has to stall. 

#### **5. What is Arithmetic in COA?**  
Arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division) are performed using different hardware units like ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit).  

#### **6. What is Cache Memory and How is it Mapped?**  
Cache memory is a **small, fast** memory that stores frequently used data. It has **three mapping techniques**:  
- **Direct Mapping** (Each block maps to a fixed location)  
- **Fully Associative Mapping** (Any block can go anywhere)  
- **Set Associative Mapping** (A mix of both)  

#### **7. What is Memory Hierarchy?**  
Memory is arranged in levels based on **speed and size**:  
1. **Registers** (Fastest, smallest)  
2. **Cache Memory**  
3. **RAM (Main Memory)**  
4. **Hard Disk (Slowest, largest)**

### **Virtual Memory (Key Points)**  

1. **Definition** â†’ Virtual Memory allows a computer to use **hard disk space as extra RAM** when physical memory is full.  
2. **Purpose** â†’ Helps run large programs on systems with limited RAM.  
3. **How it Works** â†’ Data is moved between **RAM and disk (swap space)** when needed.  
4. **Page Replacement** â†’ Algorithms like **FIFO, LRU** decide which data to swap.  
5. **Advantage** â†’ Increases multitasking ability without needing extra RAM.  
6. **Disadvantage** â†’ Slower than real RAM because accessing the hard disk takes more time.  

ðŸ”¹ **Example**: Opening too many appsâ€”older ones get moved to storage to free up RAM! ðŸš€

### **Techniques for Handling Hazards**  
1. **Stalling** â€“ Delaying the next instruction until the hazard is resolved.  
2. **Forwarding (Bypassing)** â€“ Passing data directly from one stage to another without waiting.  
3. **Branch Prediction** â€“ Guessing the outcome of a branch to avoid control hazards.  
4. **Pipeline Flushing** â€“ Clearing incorrect instructions when branch predictions fail.  
5. **Register Renaming** â€“ Avoiding WAW and WAR hazards by using different registers.

## **Long Questions (LQ) Answers â€“ COA**  

### **1. Competitive Techniques for Computer Design**  
These are methods to improve **computer performance, speed, and efficiency**:  

- **Pipelining**: Executes multiple instructions in stages simultaneously.
- Example: Modern Intel and AMD processors use pipelining to execute multiple instructions at once.
Benefit: Increases instruction throughput, reducing delay
 
- ** Parallel Processing (Speed Improvement)
Concept: Uses multiple processors or cores to execute different parts of a task at the same time.
Benefit: Enhances speed and efficiency for complex computations.
-  RISC vs. CISC (Processor Design)
RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing):
Concept: Uses simple, uniform instructions executed in a single clock cycle.
Example: ARM processors in mobile phones (Appleâ€™s A-series, Qualcomm Snapdragon).
Benefit: Low power consumption and high efficiency.
CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing):
Concept: Uses complex instructions that can perform multiple operations.
Example: Intel x86 and AMD Ryzen processors in desktops and laptops.
Benefit: Suitable for heavy computing tasks like gaming and multimedia editing.
-  Cache Optimization (Memory Speed Improvement)
Concept: Uses faster cache memory (L1, L2, L3) to store frequently accessed data, reducing the need to access slower main memory.

Benefit: Speeds up processing by reducing memory access time.

### **2. Locality of Reference**  
It is a **memory access pattern** that helps optimize performance.  
- **Types of Locality:**  
  1. **Temporal Locality**: Recently used data is likely to be used again soon.  
  2. **Spatial Locality**: Nearby memory locations are accessed together.  
  3. **Sequential Locality**: Instructions/data are accessed in order.  

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** When you watch YouTube, your phone stores a bit of the video in memory (cache), so it doesnâ€™t reload every second!

### **3. Page Replacement Algorithms**  
Used in **Virtual Memory** to decide which page to remove when memory is full.  
- **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** â†’ Removes the oldest page.  
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)** â†’ Removes the least used page recently.  
- **Optimal Algorithm** â†’ Removes the page **not needed in the future** (impossible to implement perfectly).  

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** Think of it like a WhatsApp group; when it's full, **the least active member gets removed**! ðŸ˜‚
