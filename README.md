### **Grammar:**  
```
S → aaaS | ε
```  

### **Explanation:**  
- The only input symbol is **'a'**.  
- The rule `S → aaaS` ensures that 'a' appears in multiples of 3.  
- The rule `S → ε` allows an empty string (which has 0 'a's, divisible by 3).  

### **Generated Strings:**  
- `ε` (0 a’s, divisible by 3)  
- `aaa` (3 a’s, divisible by 3)  
- `aaaaaa` (6 a’s, divisible by 3)  
- `aaaaaaaaa` (9 a’s, divisible by 3)  

Thus, this grammar ensures that the number of 'a's is always a multiple of 3. ✅
