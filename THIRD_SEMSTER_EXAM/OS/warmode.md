Below is a **realistic, exam-focused, 4-hour study plan** based on your question paper pattern and the **repeated topics** from past years.

I will tell you **exactly what to study first**, in what **order**, and which **algorithms you MUST master** to score maximum marks in minimum time.

You said you’re starting from **0** and exam is in **10 hours**.

You can absolutely score well if you follow this plan.

# ✅ **FIRST: What you MUST study (100% important)**

These **4 algorithms/questions repeat EVERY YEAR**:

### **1. Banker's Algorithm (Deadlock Avoidance)**

* It always comes as an **8-mark long question**
* Same matrix repeated almost every year

### **2. SRTF Scheduling (Shortest Remaining Time First)**

* Always asked exactly with same process set

### **3. Page Replacement Algorithms**

* FIFO
* LRU
* Optimal
* Using the SAME reference string

### **4. Memory Allocation Algorithms**

* First Fit
* Best Fit
* Worst Fit
* Same partition numbers every year

These **four alone guarantee 40+ marks**.

# 🚀 **4 Hour Master Plan (GUARANTEED HIGH SCORE)**

Follow exactly:

# **Hour 1:**

### ✔ **Start with Banker's Algorithm** (Highest priority)

* Why? Repeats every year
* Worth 8 marks
* Easy once understood
* Only steps: Need Matrix → Work, Finish → Sequence

Time needed: **30 min**
Practice the repeated matrix.

### ✔ **Then SRTF Scheduling**

* Just one Gantt chart
* Easy after pattern understanding
* Practice the repeated example

Time needed: **30 min**

---

# **Hour 2:**

### ✔ **Page Replacement Algorithms**

* FIFO
* LRU
* Optimal

These 3 together use the **same reference string** every year.

Time needed: **40 min**

### ✔ **Memory Fit Algorithms**

* First-fit
* Best-fit
* Worst-fit

Time needed: **20 min**

---

# **Hour 3:**

Now finish **medium priority algorithms**:

### ✔ **Critical Section + Requirements**

* Mutual Exclusion
* Progress
* Bounded Waiting

Time: **10 min**

### ✔ **Peterson’s Algorithm**

Understand 2-process solution.

Time: **15 min**

### ✔ **Producer-Consumer Problem**

* Using semaphores
* Always asked

Time: **20 min**

### ✔ **Semaphore Numerical Problem**

E.g., counting semaphore = 7, 20 P, 15 V
Formula:
New value = 7 – 20 + 15 = 2

Time: **5 min**

---

# **Hour 4:**

Finish remaining high probability theory topics:

### ✔ **Belady’s Anomaly** (5 min)

### ✔ **Thrashing + solution** (10 min)

### ✔ **Deadlock conditions (4 conditions)** (5 min)

### ✔ **Virtual Memory + Demand Paging basics** (10 min)

### ✔ **Paging vs Segmentation** (15 min)

### ✔ **TLB Tag size formula** (10 min)

Total: **55 minutes**

---

# ⭐ **After 4 hours — You will be exam-ready with 80% marks potential.**

This plan covers:

* All repeated questions
* All long algorithms
* All high-score numericals
* All short answer theory that appears every year

---

# ❓ **Can you learn all these algorithms in 4 hours?**

Yes.
Because:

* They repeat every year
* Most questions are identical
* Numbers are the same
* Once you solve each one ONCE, you can solve any variant

You will NOT learn the whole OS subject.
You will learn **exactly what is required to pass with high marks**.

---

# ⭐ **Final Priority Order (Do NOT skip):**

### **1. Banker's Algorithm**

### **2. SRTF Scheduling**

### **3. FIFO / LRU / Optimal**

### **4. First Fit / Best Fit / Worst Fit**

### **5. Peterson + Producer-Consumer**

### **6. Page table + TLB + Address bits**

### **7. Deadlock conditions + semaphore numerical**

### **8. Belady anomaly + Thrashing**
