# ⭐ **1) Knowledge-Based Agent (6 Marks – Exam Ready)**

A **Knowledge-Based Agent** is an intelligent agent that uses a **knowledge base** to make decisions.
It collects information from the environment, stores it as knowledge, and uses reasoning to take actions.

### ⭐ Main Components

1. **Knowledge Base (KB)**
   Stores facts and rules about the world.
   Example: “If there is smoke, there may be fire.”

2. **Inference Engine**
   Uses reasoning to derive new facts from existing knowledge.
   Example: From “Smoke is detected,” the agent infers “Fire is possible.”

3. **Knowledge Acquisition**
   Method of adding new knowledge to the KB using sensors or input.

4. **Action Execution**
   Agent performs actions based on the decisions made by the inference engine.

### ⭐ How It Works

1. Perceive environment
2. Update knowledge base
3. Use inference to reason
4. Take the best action

### ⭐ Uses

– Medical diagnosis systems
– Smart assistants
– Recommendation systems

👉 **Conclusion:**
A knowledge-based agent behaves intelligently because it reasons using stored knowledge instead of simply reacting.

# ⭐ **2) Wumpus World Environment (6 Marks – Exam Ready)**

The **Wumpus World** is a simple grid-based environment used to understand knowledge-based agents and reasoning.

### ⭐ Elements in the World

* **Wumpus (monster)** → If agent enters, it dies
* **Pits (holes)** → Falling means death
* **Gold** → Agent must find and grab it
* **Agent** → Navigates the grid

### ⭐ Percepts Given to Agent

* **Stench** → Wumpus is nearby
* **Breeze** → Pit is nearby
* **Glitter** → Gold is in the same cell
* **Bump** → Agent hits a wall
* **Scream** → Wumpus is killed

### ⭐ Why Wumpus World is Important?

It teaches how agents use:

* **Reasoning**
* **Knowledge representation**
* **Logical deduction**
* **Uncertain environments**

### ⭐ Example of Reasoning

If agent senses **breeze**, it knows one of the neighboring cells may contain a pit.

👉 **Conclusion:**
Wumpus World is used to study how intelligent agents make decisions with incomplete and uncertain information.

# ⭐ **3) Expert System – Introduction (6 Marks)**

An **Expert System** is a computer system that mimics the decision-making ability of a human expert.
It solves complex problems by using **knowledge** and **reasoning rules**.

### ⭐ Features

* Works like a domain expert (doctor, engineer, lawyer)
* Uses knowledge rather than programs
* Gives explanations for decisions
* Useful for decision support

### ⭐ Components

1. **Knowledge Base** → Stores expert knowledge
2. **Inference Engine** → Applies rules to reach conclusions
3. **User Interface** → Allows users to interact with the system
4. **Explanation System** → Explains how the decision was made

### ⭐ Applications

* Medical diagnosis
* Loan approval systems
* Weather forecasting
* Machine repair assistance

👉 **Conclusion:**
Expert systems bring expert-level intelligence into computers for problem-solving.

# ⭐ **4) Design of Expert Systems (6 Marks – Exam Ready)**

Designing an expert system involves building the system in a structured way so that it behaves like a human expert.

### ⭐ Steps in Design

### **1. Knowledge Acquisition**

Gathering knowledge from human experts, books, databases, etc.

### **2. Knowledge Representation**

Storing knowledge in rules like:
**IF condition THEN action**

### **3. Building the Knowledge Base**

Collecting all rules and facts in one place.

### **4. Designing the Inference Engine**

This engine applies rules to find solutions.
It may use *forward chaining* or *backward chaining*.

### **5. Explanation Facility**

Allows the system to explain:

* Why a question was asked
* How the result was obtained

### **6. Testing and Refinement**

System is tested with real cases and improved.

### ⭐ Importance

* Makes expert knowledge available to anyone
* Helps in decision making
* Reduces human error

👉 **Conclusion:**
Expert system design focuses on knowledge collection, rule creation, an inference engine, and explanation tools to solve real-world problems.
