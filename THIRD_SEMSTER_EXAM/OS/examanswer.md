# **⭐ 8-MARK ANSWER (FULLY EXPANDED + SIMPLE ENGLISH + EXAMPLES)**

# **1️⃣ Major Activities of an Operating System**

An Operating System (OS) performs several important activities to manage the whole computer system smoothly.
The major activities are:

---

## **1. Process Management**

The OS handles the creation, execution, and termination of processes. It also switches the CPU between multiple processes.

**Example:**
When you switch from YouTube to WhatsApp, the OS pauses one app and resumes the other.

---

## **2. Memory Management**

The OS gives memory to each running program and frees the memory when the program finishes. It keeps track of which part of memory is used by which program.

**Example:**
When you open a game, OS loads it into memory. When you close it, OS frees that space.

---

## **3. File Management**

The OS manages files on storage devices. It takes care of creating, deleting, reading, writing, and organizing files and folders.

**Example:**
Saving a PDF, renaming a photo, or deleting a video — all are done through OS file management.

---

## **4. I/O Device Management**

The OS controls input/output devices like keyboard, mouse, printer, monitor, and USB drives. It acts as a manager between the device and the user.

**Example:**
When you type with a keyboard, the OS reads the key.
When you print, the OS sends the document to the printer.

---

## **5. Security and Protection**

The OS protects data, memory, and files from unauthorized access or misuse. It also provides authentication like passwords and permissions.

**Example:**
Lock screen password, file access permissions, and stopping harmful apps are part of OS security.

---

## **6. Error Detection and Handling**

The OS constantly checks for errors in hardware and software and takes steps to fix or report them.

**Example:**
“USB not recognized” or "Low memory" notifications are given by the OS.

---

## **7. Resource Allocation**

When multiple users or programs run at the same time, the OS decides how to share CPU, memory, and devices.

**Example:**
If three apps are open, OS decides how much CPU time each gets.

---

## **8. Accounting / Monitoring**

The OS keeps track of which resources are used by which program.

**Example:**
Task Manager showing CPU and memory usage.

---

# **✨ SHORT SUMMARY FOR EXAM**

OS mainly manages **processes, memory, files, I/O devices, security, errors, resource allocation, and accounting**.

---

---

# **2️⃣ Advantages of Layered Approach to System Design**

Layered approach divides the OS into multiple layers, where each layer performs a specific function and uses only the layer below it.

---

## **1. Simplicity (Easy to Understand)**

Each layer handles one task, so the entire OS becomes simpler to study and design.

**Example:**
One layer for memory, one for CPU scheduling — easy to follow.

---

## **2. Easier Debugging and Testing**

If an error occurs, we only check the layer where the problem exists.
Other layers remain safe.

**Example:**
If a file-related bug appears, only the file layer needs checking, not the whole OS.

---

## **3. Easy to Modify / Update**

Changes in one layer do not affect other layers.
OS updates become easier and safer.

**Example:**
Upgrading memory management doesn’t disturb the file system layer.

---

## **4. Better System Organization**

Dividing into layers keeps the system neat and structured.

**Example:**
Just like arranging clothes in separate drawers — everything is organized.

---

## **5. Higher Security**

Upper layers cannot directly access hardware; they must go through lower layers.
This prevents misuse and improves protection.

**Example:**
Applications must go through OS layers to access memory or devices.

---

## **6. Portability**

Lower hardware-specific layers can be changed for a new machine without touching upper layers.

**Example:**
Same OS design can run on different processors by modifying only one layer.

---

# **✨ SHORT SUMMARY FOR EXAM**

Layered approach gives **simplicity, easy debugging, easy modification, better organization, higher security, and portability**.
