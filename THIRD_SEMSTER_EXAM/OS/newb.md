Based on a detailed comparison between the **2023-24 paper** (the images you uploaded) and the **2022-23 paper** (the text provided in your prompt), there is a **massive amount of repetition**.

The pattern suggests that the question bank is very consistent. If you master the 2022-23 paper, you would have been able to answer almost 80% of the 2023-24 paper perfectly.

Here is the topic-wise and module-wise breakdown of the repetitive questions:

### 1. The "Exact Copy-Paste" Questions (High Priority)
These questions appeared in **both years** with **identical numbers and data**. You must practice these specifically as they seem to be favorites.

* **Banker's Algorithm (Deadlock):**
    * *2023-24:* Q4(a)
    * *2022-23:* Q4(b)
    * **Note:** The Allocation/Max matrices are **exactly the same**. If you solve this one problem, you are likely covered for this topic.
* **CPU Scheduling (SRTF):**
    * *2023-24:* Q3(a)
    * *2022-23:* Q3(b)
    * **Note:** The processes (P1-P4) and Burst Times (5, 3, 3, 1) are **identical**.
* **Page Replacement Algorithms (FIFO, LRU, Optimal):**
    * *2023-24:* Q6(a)
    * *2022-23:* Q5(b)
    * **Note:** The reference string `1 2 1 3 7 4 5 6 3 1` is **identical**.
* **Memory Allocation (First-fit, Best-fit, Worst-fit):**
    * *2023-24:* Part-II Q(g)
    * *2022-23:* Part-II Q(k)
    * **Note:** The partition sizes (200k, 500k...) and process sizes (212k, 417k...) are **identical**.

### 2. Repetitive Theory Topics (By Module)

#### **Module: Introduction & Process Management**
* **Spooling:** Appeared as Q1(a) in **both** years.
* **Priority Scheduling Problem:** Appeared as Q1(c) in **both** years.
* **Lightweight vs. Heavyweight Process:** Appeared as Q1(d) in **both** years.
* **Spinlock:** Appeared as Q1(f) in **both** years.
* **Process States:** Diagram and explanation asked in both (Part-II).
* **Threads vs. Processes:** Asked in Part-II (2022) and Part-III (2023).

#### **Module: Memory Management**
* **Belady’s Anomaly:** Q1(g) in **both** years.
* **Thrashing:** Definition and solution asked in Part-II of **both** years.
* **Virtual Memory:** Implementation techniques asked in Part-II of **both** years.
* **Paging vs. Segmentation:** Differentiation asked in Part-II (2022) and Part-III (2023).
* **Calculations:**
    * Average instruction time with page fault (Formula derivation) - **Both years**.
    * Page table entries calculation - **Both years**.

#### **Module: Process Synchronization & Deadlock**
* **Producer-Consumer Problem:** Asked in Part-III of **both** years.
* **Deadlock Conditions:** State the four conditions - asked in Part-II of **both** years.
* **Semaphore Calculation:** The problem "Counting semaphore value is 7, 20 P-operations, 15 V-operations..." is in **both** years.

### 3. What Changed? (Non-Repetitive)
While most topics repeated, these were unique to specific years:
* **2023-24 Only:** TLB Tag size calculation, Critical Section requirements, Layered Approach advantages.
* **2022-23 Only:** Disk Scheduling (SCAN, C-SCAN), RAID levels, Unix Inode calculation, Multiprocessing vs Multiprogramming.

### **Summary Strategy for You:**
If you are preparing for an upcoming exam based on this pattern, **focus 80% of your energy on these 4 numerical types**:
1.  **Banker's Algorithm** (Practice the matrix given in Q4).
2.  **SRTF Scheduling** (Practice the table given in Q3).
3.  **Page Replacement** (Practice the string starting with 1 2 1 3...).
4.  **Memory Fit Algorithms** (Practice the 200k, 500k partitions).

It is highly probable that at least 2 out of these 4 long questions will appear again, possibly with the same numbers.
