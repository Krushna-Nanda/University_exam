Below is a **clear, point-by-point comparison** between your **OLD syllabus** and **NEW syllabus** for Operating System.
This will help you decide what to study for tomorrow's exam.

---

# **Are the two syllabi same?**

**No. They are NOT the same.**
The **new syllabus is significantly updated, reorganized, and contains new topics** that were NOT present in the old syllabus.

You must follow the **NEW syllabus** for your exam.

# **Comparison: Old vs New Syllabus (Module-wise)**

## **MODULE–1**

### **Old Syllabus**

* Introduction to OS
* How OS takes system control
* Functions of OS
* Evolution / Generations of OS
* OS structure
* Process concepts
* Process states
* Process control

### **New Syllabus**

Includes everything from old + **NEW topics:**

* Abstract view of OS
* System structures
* System calls (more detailed)
* **Process relationship**
* **Process state transitions**
* **Context switching**
* **Threads (concept, benefits, types)**

### **Conclusion:**

**New module is bigger**.
You must study additional topics: **process relationship, transitions, context switching, threads (concept + types).**

---

## **MODULE–2**

### **Old Syllabus**

* Process creation, termination
* Threads (basic)
* Scheduling: types & algorithms
* Only overview of scheduling
* No detailed objectives & criteria

### **New Syllabus**

Includes all scheduling + **NEW additions:**

* Scheduling objectives
* Scheduling criteria (CPU utilization, throughput, etc.)
* **Banker’s algorithm** moved here
* **Deadlock detection & recovery** (more detailed than old syllabus)

### **Conclusion:**

This module adds:

* Scheduling criteria
* Scheduling objectives
* **Detailed deadlock detection & recovery**
* **Banker's algorithm is explicitly required**

---

## **MODULE–3**

### **Old Syllabus**

* Synchronization basics
* Critical section
* Race condition
* Classical problems
* Semaphores, message passing
* Deadlock handling

### **New Syllabus**

Contains similar topics but **adds more depth**:

* **Peterson’s solution**
* **Monitors**
* **Message Passing (extended)**
* **More classical IPC problems:**

  * Readers-Writers
  * Dining Philosophers
* Memory management includes:

  * **Swapping** (NEW)
  * **Internal & external fragmentation** (NEW)
  * **Compaction** (NEW)
  * Allocation of frames (NEW)

### **Conclusion:**

New module adds several major new areas, especially:

* Peterson’s solution
* Monitors
* More IPC problems
* Swapping
* Fragmentation
* Frame allocation

---

## **MODULE–4**

### **Old Syllabus**

* Memory management
* Virtual memory
* Paging
* Segmentation
* Thrashing

### **New Syllabus**

This module is **entirely NEW**, because it has:

* **Disk management**
* Disk structure
* Disk scheduling
* RAID
* **I/O management**
* DMA
* **File management**

  * File types
  * Access methods
  * Directory structure
  * Allocation methods
* **Security & Protection**

  * Security environment
  * Authentication
  * Design principles

### **Conclusion:**

This is **completely NEW material**.
Nothing in this module was present in the old syllabus.

---

# **Summary — Are they same?**

**NO. The new syllabus is different and more modern.**
You MUST follow the **NEW syllabus** for the exam.

---

# **What NEW topics were added (Important list):**

### **Module-1 New Additions**

* Abstract view of OS
* System structures
* System calls (expanded)
* Process relationship
* Process state transitions
* Context switching
* Threads (concept, benefits, types)

### **Module-2 New Additions**

* Scheduling objectives
* Scheduling criteria
* **Detailed Deadlock Detection & Recovery**
* **Banker’s Algorithm** clearly included

### **Module-3 New Additions**

* Peterson’s solution
* Monitors
* More classical IPC problems (Readers-Writers, Dining Philosophers)
* Swapping
* Fragmentation (internal + external)
* Compaction
* Frame allocation

### **Module-4 (Completely New)**

* Disk management
* Disk scheduling
* RAID levels
* I/O management & DMA
* File management (file types, directories, allocation)
* Security & protection
* Authentication

---

# **FINAL ADVICE FOR EXAM**

Study the **NEW syllabus only**.
Your exam questions will come from:

* CPU scheduling algorithms
* Deadlock (Banker’s algorithm)
* Memory Management (paging, segmentation, fragmentation, thrashing)
* IPC (sem, monitors, Peterson, classical problems)
* Disk scheduling
* File systems
* Security & authentication
