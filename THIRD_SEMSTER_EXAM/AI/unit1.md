# ⭐ **TYPES OF INTELLIGENT AGENTS**

Intelligent agents are systems that perceive the environment through sensors and act upon it using actuators.
Different agents use different internal architectures to decide actions.
The main types of intelligent agents are:

---

## **1) Simple Reflex Agent**

* Works only on the **current percept**.
* Uses **condition–action rules** (IF–THEN).
* No memory of past states.
* Suitable for simple, fully observable environments.

**Example:**
“If traffic light is red → stop.”

---

## **2) Model-Based Reflex Agent**

* Maintains an **internal model** of the environment.
* Uses **memory** to keep track of unobserved states.
* Handles **partially observable environments**.

**Example:**
Wumpus world agent remembering previous safe cells.

---

## **3) Goal-Based Agent**

* Chooses actions by considering **goals**.
* Uses **search and planning** to reach the goal state.
* More flexible and intelligent than reflex agents.

**Example:**
Navigation system finding shortest path to destination.

---

## **4) Utility-Based Agent**

* Uses a **utility function** to evaluate how desirable each state is.
* Selects the action with **maximum expected utility**.
* Balances preferences such as speed, safety, or cost.

**Example:**
Self-driving car choosing safest + fastest route.

---

## **5) Learning Agent**

* Improves performance with **experience**.
* Has four components:

  * **Learning element**
  * **Performance element**
  * **Critic**
  * **Problem generator**
* Adapts automatically to changes in environment.

**Example:**
Reinforcement learning agents (like AlphaGo).

---

# ✨ **Conclusion**

These five types represent **different architectures** for designing intelligent agents.
From simple rule-based behavior to advanced learning mechanisms, each type provides increasing levels of intelligence and flexibility.

# ⭐ **TYPES OF INTELLIGENT AGENTS (Very Simple English + Expanded)**

An **intelligent agent** is a machine or program that **sees what is happening around it** (sensors) and **takes actions** (actuators) to reach a goal.
Different intelligent agents work in different ways.
These ways are called **types of intelligent agents**.

There are **five main types**:

---

# 🔵 **1) Simple Reflex Agent**

A simple reflex agent looks only at the **current input** and takes action.
It does **not remember anything** from the past.
It works using simple **IF–THEN rules**.

### ✔ Features (very simple):

* Only uses present input
* No memory
* Uses rules like “IF this happens THEN do this”
* Works only in simple environments

### ✔ Example:

A vacuum cleaner robot that has a rule:
“If the floor is dirty → clean it.”
It does not remember where it cleaned before.

---

# 🟢 **2) Model-Based Reflex Agent**

This agent is smarter than the simple reflex agent.
It has a **memory** and keeps an **internal model** of the world.
So even if it cannot see something now, it remembers what happened earlier.

### ✔ Features:

* Has memory
* Can handle partially observable environments
* Uses rules + stored information
* Understands what might be happening even if it can’t see it directly

### ✔ Example:

Wumpus world game agent:
It remembers which cells are safe and which might have danger.

---

# 🟡 **3) Goal-Based Agent**

This agent does not act only on present input.
It also thinks about a **goal** → “Where do I want to go?”
It uses **search** and **planning** to reach that goal.

### ✔ Features:

* Works toward a goal
* Thinks about future results
* Uses search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*)
* More flexible and smarter than reflex agents

### ✔ Example:

Google Maps:
Its goal is to take you to your destination.
It searches for the best route.

---

# 🟠 **4) Utility-Based Agent**

This agent not only has a goal, it also thinks about **which action gives the best quality outcome**.
It compares many actions and picks the one with the **highest utility** (happiness, safety, speed, comfort).

### ✔ Features:

* Chooses the “best” action, not just any action
* Uses a **utility function**
* Handles situations where many goals or many options exist
* Works well in complex environments

### ✔ Example:

A self-driving car:
It chooses a route that is not only fast but also safe and comfortable.

---

# 🔴 **5) Learning Agent**

A learning agent can **learn from experience**.
Its performance becomes better and better over time.
It changes its behavior based on feedback.

### ✔ Features:

* Learns from past actions
* Improves with time
* Has learning element, performance element, critic, problem generator
* Works well in dynamic and changing environments

### ✔ Example:

AlphaGo or reinforcement learning agent:
It becomes stronger by playing many games and learning from mistakes.

---

# ✨ **Conclusion (Simple English)**

These five types show **different ways of building an intelligent agent**.
Some agents follow simple rules, some use memory, some plan using goals, some measure utility, and some learn from experience.
As we go from simple reflex to learning agents, the agent becomes more intelligent and more powerful.
