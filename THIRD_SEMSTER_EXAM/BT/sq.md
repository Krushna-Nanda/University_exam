# ⭐ **Module-IV – Full Unit in 5 Minutes (Ultra-Short Notes)**

---

# **1️⃣ Working With Bitcoin**

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that allows peer-to-peer transactions without a central authority.

---

# **2️⃣ Merkle Trees**

* A Merkle Tree is a **binary hash tree**.
* It stores transaction hashes.
* The root hash (Merkle Root) summarizes all transactions in a block.
* Helps quickly verify transactions without downloading whole block.

---

# **3️⃣ Bitcoin Block Structure**

A block contains:

1. Block header

   * Previous block hash
   * Merkle root
   * Timestamp
   * Nonce
2. Block body

   * List of transactions

Blocks link together forming the blockchain.

---

# **4️⃣ Bitcoin Addresses**

* Used to send/receive bitcoins.
* Derived from public keys using hashing.
* Work like an account number.

---

# **5️⃣ Bitcoin Transactions**

* Contain sender, receiver, amount, digital signature.
* Verified by miners before entering a block.
* Immutable once confirmed.

---

# **6️⃣ Bitcoin Networks**

Bitcoin works on a **peer-to-peer network** where nodes share blocks and transactions without any central server.

---

# **7️⃣ Bitcoin Clients**

Software used to interact with the Bitcoin network:

* Bitcoin Core
* Lightweight wallets
  They validate blocks and broadcast transactions.

---

# **8️⃣ Bitcoin Wallets & Payments**

* Wallets store **private keys**, not coins.
* Types: software, hardware, paper wallets.
* Payments occur by digitally signing a transaction.

---

# **9️⃣ Bitcoin Supply**

* Maximum supply: **21 million coins**.
* New bitcoins are created only through mining.
* Supply reduces every 4 years through **halving**.

---

# **🔟 Bitcoin Mining**

Mining = validating transactions + creating new blocks.

Steps:

1. Collect transactions
2. Build a block
3. Solve Proof-of-Work puzzle (nonce)
4. Winner adds block + earns reward

---

# **1️⃣1️⃣ Block Validation & Identification**

Nodes check:

* Hash < target value
* Correct Merkle root
* Valid transactions
* Correct previous hash

If valid → block added to blockchain.

---

# **1️⃣2️⃣ Block Creation**

Miner:

1. Builds block header
2. Adds transactions
3. Computes nonce
4. Sends completed block to network

---

# **1️⃣3️⃣ Mining Hardware & Software**

* **Hardware:** ASICs (special mining machines), GPUs
* **Software:** CGMiner, BFGMiner, EasyMiner

ASICs are fastest and most widely used.

---

# **1️⃣4️⃣ Bitcoin Management & Swarm**

* Nodes work together like a **swarm**.
* They share, validate, and propagate blocks.
* Ensures decentralized network management.

---

# **1️⃣5️⃣ Blockchain in Insurance**

* Reduces fraud
* Faster claim verification
* Transparent policy management

---

# **1️⃣6️⃣ Blockchain in Healthcare**

* Secure medical records
* Patient data sharing with privacy
* Prevents data tampering

---

# **1️⃣7️⃣ Blockchain in Cloud Computing**

* Distributed storage
* No central server
* Higher security and availability

---

# **1️⃣8️⃣ Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence**

* Secure data for AI training
* Transparent AI decision tracking
* Decentralized AI models

---
