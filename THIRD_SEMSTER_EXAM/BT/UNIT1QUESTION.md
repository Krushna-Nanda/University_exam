# ✅ **6 MARK ANSWER 1: Characteristics of Blockchain**

Blockchain has several key characteristics that make it secure, transparent, and reliable.
The main characteristics are:

### **1. Decentralization**

Blockchain does not depend on a single central server or authority.
Data is stored across many computers (nodes), reducing the risk of failure or control by one party.

### **2. Immutability**

Once data is written into a block and added to the chain, it cannot be changed or deleted.
This makes the system tamper-proof.

### **3. Transparency**

All transactions on a public blockchain are visible to all participants.
Although identities are hidden behind wallet addresses, the transaction data is viewable.

### **4. Security**

Blockchain uses cryptographic hashing and digital signatures to secure data.
Each block contains its own hash and the hash of the previous block, making it extremely difficult to alter.

### **5. Distributed Ledger**

Every node on the network has the same copy of the ledger.
If one node fails, the system continues to work because other copies exist.

### **6. Consensus Mechanism**

Before adding a new block, all nodes must agree that the transaction is valid.
This agreement is reached through algorithms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).

# 🔥 **6 MARK ANSWER 2: Architecture of Blockchain**

The architecture of blockchain defines how the system is structured and how data flows through the network.

### **1. Nodes**

These are computers connected to the blockchain network.
Nodes store a copy of the ledger, validate transactions, and maintain network security.

### **2. Blocks**

A block contains:

* A list of verified transactions
* Timestamp
* Nonce
* Hash of the current block
* Hash of the previous block

Blocks are linked together to form a chain.

### **3. Hash Function**

Each block has a unique hash value generated using a cryptographic hashing algorithm.
Any small change in data produces a completely different hash, ensuring data integrity.

### **4. Chain of Blocks**

Every new block contains the hash of the previous block, creating a connected chain.
This linking prevents tampering, because changing one block would break all following blocks.

### **5. Transactions**

A transaction is a record of data (like sending cryptocurrency).
Nodes validate transactions before adding them into a block.

### **6. Consensus Layer**

Blockchain uses consensus algorithms such as Proof of Work or Proof of Stake to agree on which block should be added next.
This ensures that all nodes follow the same rules and maintain a single valid ledger.

# ✅ **6 MARK ANSWER: Public, Private and Hybrid Blockchains**

Blockchain networks can be classified into three types based on who can access, control, and participate in the system. They are **Public**, **Private**, and **Hybrid** blockchains.

---

## **1. Public Blockchain**

A public blockchain is an open network where **anyone can join, read, write, or verify transactions**.
It is fully decentralized and transparent.

### **Features:**

1. No permission required to join.
2. Anyone can run a node or participate in validation.
3. High transparency because all data is visible to everyone.
4. Fully decentralized with no central authority.
5. Examples include **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum**.

---

## **2. Private Blockchain**

A private blockchain is a restricted network where only selected and authorized participants are allowed to join.
It is controlled by a single organization.

### **Features:**

1. Access is limited to specific users.
2. Controlled by a company or organization.
3. Faster than public blockchains due to fewer participants.
4. Used for internal business processes.
5. Examples: **Hyperledger Fabric**, **R3 Corda**.

---

## **3. Hybrid Blockchain**

A hybrid blockchain combines elements of both public and private blockchains.
Some data is public, while some remains private and accessible only to authorized users.

### **Features:**

1. Controlled access for sensitive data.
2. Public part allows transparency where needed.
3. Private part ensures data confidentiality.
4. Flexible for large organizations like governments.
5. Example: **Ripple**, government identity systems.
