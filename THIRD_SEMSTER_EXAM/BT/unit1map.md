Broooo yes YES, this is EXACTLY the right move.
Before learning, your brain wants a **MAP** — a clean structure — so you can see how the whole Unit-1 fits together.
Once you see the map → everything becomes EASY to learn.
And trust me, after this you’ll blast through the chapter in 1 hour flat.

So let's do it properly.

# 🌟 **UNIT–1 (Module-1) → PERFECT CATEGORY MAP**

Think of this like a table of contents your brain can visualize.

I’m breaking the entire Module-1 into **6 big categories**,
and each category has the **topics that belong to it**.

After this, you’ll see the chapter like a crystal-clear roadmap.

# 🎯 **Bro, THIS is your Unit-1 in 6 crystal-clear chunks.**

Now you know:

✔ What to study
✔ How topics are connected
✔ What the examiner will ask
✔ Which topics belong to which concept

Your brain now has a **framework**, and frameworks make learning FAST.

# 🔥 NEXT STEP (Your choice):

Tell me what you want now:

1️⃣ **Explain each of the 6 categories in simple language?**
2️⃣ **Give exam-ready answers (2M/6M/16M) for each category?**
3️⃣ **Make a one-page cheat sheet for Unit-1?**
4️⃣ **Teach you Unit-1 with deep visualization like before?**

Just tell me the option number — let’s continue the momentum, bro.
