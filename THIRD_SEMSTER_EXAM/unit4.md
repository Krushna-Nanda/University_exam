## **🌟Q1) Describe the common symptoms of a sick small-scale industry and how early detection can help in revival. (16 Marks)**

### **Meaning of Sick Industry:**

A sick industry is a business that **cannot run its daily activities smoothly**, fails to **repay bank loans**, and is unable to meet expenses like **salary, raw materials, and electricity bills.**

---

### **Symptoms of Sickness (FPLD):**

#### **1. F – Falling Sales:**

When sales continuously drop, it shows customers are losing interest.
**Example:** A textile unit sold ₹5 lakh worth of goods last month, but now only sells ₹2.5 lakh every month.

#### **2. P – Poor Cash Flow:**

The business does not have enough working capital for daily operations.
**Example:** The owner asks suppliers for extra credit because he cannot pay immediately.

#### **3. L – Low Capacity Utilization:**

Machines and manpower are not used fully.
**Example:** A bakery that can produce 1,000 loaves daily is making only 300.

#### **4. D – Delay in Payments:**

Regular delay in paying suppliers, salaries, or loan EMIs.
**Example:** Employees receive salaries after 20 days instead of the usual monthly date.

---

### **Importance of Early Detection:**

Early detection of sickness helps the business take quick corrective action before the situation becomes serious. Early action can lead to revival instead of closure.

Early detection helps in the following ways:

---

#### ✅ **1. Control Losses:**

If problems are identified early, unnecessary expenses can be reduced.
**Example:** If bad-quality raw materials are causing waste, the company can replace the supplier early instead of losing lakhs.

---

#### ✅ **2. Improve Management:**

If mismanagement is the reason, new trained managers or experts can replace the old ones.
**Example:** A new production manager may reduce waste, improve inventory control, and increase efficiency.

---

#### ✅ **3. Get Bank or Government Support:**

Banks provide loan restructuring, working capital, or rehabilitation packages once sickness is reported early.
**Example:** A bank may extend EMI repayment for 3 years and reduce interest rate to help revive the unit.

---

#### ✅ **4. Avoid Closure and Restart Growth:**

Timely action helps stabilize operations, retain employees, and rebuild market trust before the business reaches a shutdown stage.
**Example:** A small handloom unit improves marketing and restarts sales before losing suppliers and customers permanently.

---

### **Conclusion:**

If symptoms like **falling sales, poor cash flow, low production, and delayed payments** are detected early, the company can take corrective steps such as improving management, reducing cost, and getting financial help. This early detection plays a key role in **saving the business and bringing it back to growth.**
