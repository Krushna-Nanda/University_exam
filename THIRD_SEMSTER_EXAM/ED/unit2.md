### **2️⃣ Identification of Opportunities**

Entrepreneurs observe trends, gaps, and customer complaints to find opportunities.

**Example:**
People wanted fast food delivery → **Swiggy and Zomato** became successful.

---

### **3️⃣ Converting Opportunities into Reality**

After identifying the idea, the entrepreneur takes steps like planning, arranging finance, selecting location, hiring staff, and starting operations.

**Example:**
Idea: People need affordable local cab service → Reality: **OLA** started with drivers, mobile app, and simple pricing.

**Example:** A startup building a mobile app works in an incubator instead of renting an expensive office.

Networking helps in collaboration, partnerships, and business growth.
