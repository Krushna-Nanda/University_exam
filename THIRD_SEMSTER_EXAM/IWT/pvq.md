### Q6.

The United States federal personal income tax is calculated based on filing status and taxable income. There are four filing statuses: single filers, married filing jointly or qualified widow(er), married filing separately, and head of household. The tax rates vary every year. Table below shows the rates for 2009.

If you are, say, single with a taxable income of $10,000, the first $8,350 is taxed at 10% and the other $1,650 is taxed at 15%, so your total tax is $1,082.50. Write a program using HTML and JavaScript to take input from user about their filing status and taxable income. After the user submits the details, the tax payable is calculated and displayed to the user.

*(Table 3.2: 2009 U.S. Federal Personal Tax Rates)*

| Marginal Tax Rate | Single              | Married Filing Jointly or Qualifying Widow(er) | Married Filing Separately | Head of Household   |

| **15%**           | $8,351 – $33,950    | $16,701 – $67,900                              | $8,351 – $33,950          | $11,951 – $45,500   |
| **25%**           | $33,951 – $82,250   | $67,901 – $137,050                             | $33,951 – $68,525         | $45,501 – $117,450  |

| **33%**           | $171,551 – $372,950 | $208,851 – $372,950                            | $104,426 – $186,475       | $190,201 – $372,950 |
| **35%**           | $372,951+           | $372,951+                                      | $186,476+                 | $372,951+           |
