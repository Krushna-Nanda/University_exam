e) Explain with suitable examples the scope, visibility, and lifetime of auto, external, static, and register variables.

f) Write a program to print the values of sin(x) in the interval 0 to 180 degrees in steps of 15 degrees. x is in degrees. Do not use any library functions. The accuracy of sin(x) must not be less than 0.00001.

g) Define a pointer. Discuss the declaration and initialization of the pointer variable. Define a function that uses pointers to take two matrices as input and returns their product.

h) An electricity board charges the following rates for the use of electricity: for the first 200 units 80 paise per unit; for the next 100 units 90 paise per unit; beyond 300 units Rs. 1 per unit. All users are charged a minimum of Rs. 100 as meter charge. If the total amount is more than Rs. 400, then an additional surcharge of 15% of the total amount is charged. Write a C program to read the name of the user, number of units consumed and print out the charges.

i) Differentiate properly the various modes of opening a file in C programming. Write a C program to create a file to store sequentially a list of products with the data - ID, Name, Rate, and Quantity.

j) How many queues are needed to implement a stack? Consider the situation where no other data structure like arrays, linked list is available to you. Justify your answer. Evaluate the following postfix expression with single-digit operands using a stack: 8234/23*+51-

k) Show the detailed steps to convert given infix to postfix: p+q*r+(s*t+u)*v

You are required to rank the students of a classroom based on their marks in a particular subject. Define a student structure containing the members ID, Name, Marks, and Rank. Provide user input facility for 10 students' data (ID, Name, Marks). Give the rank values as per the student ranking in the class. Define functions to print the data as a table. (16 marks)
