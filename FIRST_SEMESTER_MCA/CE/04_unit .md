Understand the Purpose
When you read something, ask yourself: Why was it written? Is it trying to give information, explain something, or just entertain you? For example, a news article informs, while a story entertains.

### **Two Strategies for Vocabulary Building with Examples**  

1. **Using Context Clues**:  
   - Guess the meaning of a word based on how it’s used in a sentence.  
   - Example: “The desert was arid, with no water for miles.” The word "arid" means "dry" because the sentence talks about no water.  

2. **Reading Regularly**:  
   - Read books, articles, or blogs to find new words and see how they are used.  
   - Example: In a novel, you might find the word “benevolent,” meaning kind, used in the phrase “a benevolent ruler.”
