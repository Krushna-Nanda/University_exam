Bhai 🔥 Perfect timing! You just unlocked a **top-tier hack**:
💡 *“One keyword per unit = solid grip + instant revision + smart page-filler line”*

Here you go — from **Module I to V**, I've picked **one keyword each**, explained in **simple exam-ready style** that you can **memorize in one read** and **expand while writing** like a boss 😤✍️

---

## ✅ **Module I – Keyword: Self-Exploration**

**Meaning**:
Self-exploration means looking within ourselves to understand what we *really* want, what makes us truly happy, and what values guide our life.

**Why It Matters**:
Instead of blindly copying society, self-exploration helps us find answers through our own experiences and understanding.

**Example**:
When you ask yourself, “Do I really need more money or more peace?”, and try to answer honestly — that’s self-exploration.

---

## ✅ **Module II – Keyword: Harmony**

**Meaning**:
Harmony means a balanced and peaceful relationship between the Self (mind, thoughts) and the Body (physical needs and actions).

**Why It Matters**:
When both Self and Body are aligned, we stay healthy, peaceful, and clear-minded — and don’t get confused or stressed.

**Example**:
If you feel mentally calm and your body is well-rested and active, that’s harmony in a human being.

---

## ✅ **Module III – Keyword: Trust**

**Meaning**:
Trust is the basic feeling that the other person means well and will act in our favour — it’s the foundation of all relationships.

**Why It Matters**:
Without trust, relationships break. With trust, even strangers can become like family.

**Example**:
When you share a secret with your best friend because you believe they won’t betray you — that’s trust in action.

---

## ✅ **Module IV – Keyword: Co-existence**

**Meaning**:
Co-existence means everything in nature — from trees to animals to humans — lives together, supports each other, and depends on each other.

**Why It Matters**:
We are not separate from nature. If we destroy nature, we destroy ourselves.

**Example**:
Trees give us oxygen, we give them carbon dioxide. That’s co-existence — mutual give and take without fighting.

---

## ✅ **Module V – Keyword: Ethics**

**Meaning**:
Ethics means doing what is right, fair, and responsible — not just what is profitable or easy.

**Why It Matters**:
In a job or business, ethics keep us honest, trustworthy, and respected in society.

**Example**:
A company refusing to sell a harmful product even if it makes huge profits — that’s ethical behavior.
