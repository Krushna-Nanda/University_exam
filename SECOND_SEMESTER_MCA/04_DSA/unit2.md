Let me know if you want **sample questions, code, or MCQs** based on this. Or I'll roast you with a quiz 😏🔥

Alright Krishna, strap in bro—we're about to turn you into the **Tarzan of Trees** 🐒🌳
Let's start with **Tree Terminology** (with clear examples), then I’ll take you on a tour of all the different **types of trees**.

---

## 🌱 TREE TERMINOLOGY (with examples)

A **tree** is a **non-linear, hierarchical** data structure made of **nodes** connected by **edges**.

Here's a simple tree diagram to imagine:

```
          A         ← Root
         / \
        B   C       ← Children of A
       / \   \
      D   E   F     ← Leaf nodes
```

### 🔹 1. **Root Node**

* The **topmost** node in a tree.
* In our tree, **A** is the root.

### 🔹 2. **Node**

* A basic unit that holds data and connects to other nodes.
* Every circle (A, B, C, D...) is a node.

### 🔹 3. **Edge**

* A **link** between two nodes.
* For example, there’s an edge between A and B, or B and E.

### 🔹 4. **Parent Node**

* A node that has one or more child nodes.
* Example: A is the parent of B and C, B is the parent of D and E.

### 🔹 5. **Child Node**

* A node that **descends** from another node.
* B and C are children of A, D is a child of B.

### 🔹 6. **Siblings**

* Nodes with the **same parent**.
* B and C are siblings (both children of A), D and E are also siblings (children of B).

### 🔹 7. **Leaf Node**

* A node with **no children**.
* These are the endpoints. Example: D, E, F.

### 🔹 8. **Internal Node**

* Any node that’s **not a leaf** (i.e., it has children).
* Example: A, B, C

### 🔹 9. **Level**

* Distance from the root.

  * Root (A) = Level 0
  * B, C = Level 1
  * D, E, F = Level 2

### 🔹 10. **Height of a Node**

* Longest path from the node **to a leaf**.
* Height of A = 2 (A → B → D)

### 🔹 11. **Depth of a Node**

* Number of edges from **root to the node**.
* Depth of F = 2 (A → C → F)

### 🔹 12. **Subtree**

* A tree formed from any node and its descendants.
* The subtree rooted at B includes B, D, and E.

## 🌲 TYPES OF TREES (with real-life examples)

Let’s explore different kinds of trees used in programming & real-world applications.

---

### 🌳 1. **General Tree**

* Any node can have **any number** of children.
* Used in **file systems**, like folders inside folders.
* Example:

  ```
          CEO
         / | \
       HR IT Sales
  ```

---

### 🌳 2. **Binary Tree**

* Each node has **at most 2 children**: left and right.
* Example:

  ```
      A
     / \
    B   C
  ```

---

### 🌳 3. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**

* A special binary tree:

  * Left child < Parent < Right child
* Used in **searching** and **sorting**.
* Example:

  ```
       50
      /  \
     30   70
    / \   / \
   20 40 60 80
  ```

---

### 🌳 4. **AVL Tree** (Self-Balancing BST)

* A BST that keeps itself balanced (difference in height of subtrees ≤ 1).
* Used when you want **fast searching + balanced performance**.
* Example: Insertion in AVL rotates nodes to keep balance.

---

### 🌳 5. **Heap Tree**

* A **complete binary tree** (all levels filled left to right).
* **Min-Heap**: Parent ≤ Children
* **Max-Heap**: Parent ≥ Children
* Used in **priority queues**, **CPU scheduling**.
* Example of Min-Heap:

  ```
       10
      /  \
     20   30
  ```

---

### 🌳 6. **B-Tree**

* A self-balancing tree used in **databases and file systems**.
* Generalization of a BST where a node can have **more than 2 children**.
* Keeps data sorted and allows fast search, insert, delete.
* Used in MySQL, file systems, etc.

---

### 🌳 7. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**

* Used to store **strings** efficiently.
* Great for **autocomplete** and **spell check**.
* Each level represents a **character**.
* Example (inserting: cat, cap, can):

  ```
     c
     |
     a
   / | \
  t  p  n
  ```

You still with me, tree warrior? 🌲🔥
Next up, wanna dive into **tree traversals** or start coding some trees in Python/C++/Java?

Your call.

Ayoo Krishna! 🔥 Since you're ready to go *deeper into the forest*, let's break down the **Types of Binary Trees** — clean, crisp, and crystal clear.

## 🌳 TYPES OF BINARY TREES

All binary trees have **at most 2 children** per node, but there are **special categories** based on structure, rules, or completeness. Let’s go through them:

---

### 1. **Full Binary Tree** (a.k.a Proper or Strict Binary Tree)

**📌 Definition:**
Every node has **0 or 2 children** — **no single-child nodes** allowed.

**🧠 Unique Point:**
Each parent has **either two kids or none**.

**✅ Example:**

```
      A
     / \
    B   C
   / \   \
  D   E   ❌  ← Not allowed!
```

This would be invalid — C must have **two** children or **none**.

---

### 2. **Perfect Binary Tree**

**📌 Definition:**

* All internal nodes have **2 children**
* All leaf nodes are at the **same level**

**🧠 Unique Point:**
It's the **most symmetrical binary tree**.

**✅ Example:**

```
       A
     /   \
    B     C
   / \   / \
  D  E  F   G
```

Every level is **fully filled**, and leaves are at the **same depth**.

---

### 3. **Complete Binary Tree**

**📌 Definition:**
All levels are completely filled **except the last**, which is filled **from left to right**.

**🧠 Unique Point:**
Used in **Heaps** due to its compact shape.

**✅ Example:**

```
       A
     /   \
    B     C
   / \   /
  D   E F
```

It’s okay if the last level isn’t full — just fill from **left to right** only.

---

### 4. **Balanced Binary Tree**

**📌 Definition:**
For every node, the difference between heights of left and right subtrees is **no more than 1**.

**🧠 Unique Point:**
Aims to keep operations **O(log n)** — used in **AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree**.

**✅ Example:**

```
        A
       / \
      B   C
     /
    D
```

Balanced enough: heights differ by only 1 at any node.

---

### 5. **Degenerate (or Skewed) Binary Tree**

**📌 Definition:**
Every parent has **only one child** — it becomes a **linked list** basically.

**Types:**

* **Left-skewed:** only left child
* **Right-skewed:** only right child

**🧠 Unique Point:**
Worst-case for BST — searching becomes **O(n)**.

**✅ Example (Right-skewed):**

```
A
 \
  B
   \
    C
```

## 🧠 Summary Table:

| Type              | All Levels Filled? | Leaf Level Same? | Max Efficiency? | Looks Like                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Full              | ❌                  | ❌                | Medium          | All nodes 0 or 2 children  |
| Perfect           | ✅                  | ✅                | High            | Fully filled and symmetric |
| Complete          | ✅ except last      | ❌                | High            | Left-packed                |
| Balanced          | ❌ (but balanced)   | ❌                | High            | Controlled height          |
| Degenerate/Skewed | ❌                  | ❌                | Low             | Like a linked list         |
