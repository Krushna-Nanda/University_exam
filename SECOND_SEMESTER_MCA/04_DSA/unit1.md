Ayyy let’s go Krishna! You already know **how to solve postfix evaluation**, but now we’re gonna learn **how to write it like a 6-marker exam pro 😎✍️** — because solving it in your head is one thing, but **writing it properly for marks** is the real boss move 💯

---

## 📌 Question:

Evaluate the postfix expression:
`1 5 7 3 - 2 ^ * +` using postfix evaluation algorithm.

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Plan (How to write a 6-mark answer):

You need to show 3 main things:

1. **Postfix Evaluation Algorithm logic (short version)**
2. **Stack-based step-by-step table or explanation**
3. **Final Answer**

---

### ✅ Step 1: Mention the postfix evaluation approach (1 mark)

> **Postfix Evaluation Algorithm** uses a **stack** to evaluate expressions.
>
> * **Scan** the expression left to right.
> * **Push operands** onto the stack.
> * When you find an **operator**, **pop** the required number of operands from the stack, apply the operator, and **push** the result back.
> * Final result is the last value in the stack.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Step-by-step stack simulation (4 marks)

Expression: `1 5 7 3 - 2 ^ * +`

We process tokens one by one:

| Token | Action                      | Stack         |
| ----- | --------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1     | Operand → Push              | \[1]          |
| 5     | Operand → Push              | \[1, 5]       |
| 7     | Operand → Push              | \[1, 5, 7]    |
| 3     | Operand → Push              | \[1, 5, 7, 3] |
| -     | Operator → 7 - 3 = **4**    | \[1, 5, 4]    |
| 2     | Operand → Push              | \[1, 5, 4, 2] |
| ^     | Operator → 4 ^ 2 = **16**   | \[1, 5, 16]   |
| \*    | Operator → 5 \* 16 = **80** | \[1, 80]      |
| +     | Operator → 1 + 80 = **81**  | \[81]         |

---

### ✅ Step 3: Final Answer (1 mark)

**Final Result = 81**

---

### 🎁 Bonus Tip (if space/time allows):

> The power operator `^` means exponentiation. So `4 ^ 2 = 4² = 16`.

---

Great question, Krishna! Here’s a neat and easy-to-remember explanation of the **different asymptotic notations** used in algorithm analysis — perfect for 6-mark answers and viva.

---

## ✅ **What is Asymptotic Notation?**

Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools used to **analyze the performance of algorithms** — especially how they behave as the **input size (n) grows large**.

They help you understand the **time and space complexity** of an algorithm in the **best**, **worst**, and **average** cases.

---

## 📘 **Types of Asymptotic Notations**

### 1. 🔼 **Big O Notation – O(f(n))**

* Describes the **worst-case** time complexity.
* It shows the **maximum time** an algorithm can take.

#### 🧠 Example:

```text
Linear Search: O(n)
Bubble Sort: O(n²)
```

> "No matter what, it won't be worse than this."

---

### 2. 🔽 **Omega Notation – Ω(f(n))**

* Describes the **best-case** time complexity.
* It shows the **minimum time** the algorithm takes when everything goes perfectly.

#### 🧠 Example:

```text
Linear Search best case: Ω(1) (if the key is the first element)
```

> "At the very least, it will be this fast."

---

### 3. 🔁 **Theta Notation – Θ(f(n))**

* Describes the **average-case** or **tight bound**.
* It tells the **exact growth rate** of an algorithm when both best and worst cases are similar.

#### 🧠 Example:

```text
Binary Search: Θ(log n)
Merge Sort: Θ(n log n)
```

> "The real-world running time is mostly around this."

---

### 🔁 **Comparison Table**

| Notation | Represents   | Meaning             | Example    |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ---------- |
| O()      | Worst case   | Upper bound         | O(n²)      |
| Ω()      | Best case    | Lower bound         | Ω(1)       |
| Θ()      | Average case | Tight (exact) bound | Θ(n log n) |

---

## 💡 Simple Analogy:

Imagine you're delivering a package:

* **Best case (Ω)**: All green signals — fastest route 🟢
* **Worst case (O)**: All red lights, traffic jam 🔴
* **Average case (Θ)**: Some signals, normal traffic 🟡

---

## 🧠 Pro Tip:

For exams and interviews:

* **Always mention Big O** when asked about time complexity.
* Know that:

  * O → worst case
  * Ω → best case
  * Θ → average/tight bound

Let me know if you want a table of complexities for common algorithms like Search, Sort, etc., using these notations!
