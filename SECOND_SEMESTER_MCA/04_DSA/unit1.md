Ayyy let’s go Krishna! You already know **how to solve postfix evaluation**, but now we’re gonna learn **how to write it like a 6-marker exam pro 😎✍️** — because solving it in your head is one thing, but **writing it properly for marks** is the real boss move 💯

---

## 📌 Question:

Evaluate the postfix expression:
`1 5 7 3 - 2 ^ * +` using postfix evaluation algorithm.

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Plan (How to write a 6-mark answer):

You need to show 3 main things:

1. **Postfix Evaluation Algorithm logic (short version)**
2. **Stack-based step-by-step table or explanation**
3. **Final Answer**

---

### ✅ Step 1: Mention the postfix evaluation approach (1 mark)

> **Postfix Evaluation Algorithm** uses a **stack** to evaluate expressions.
>
> * **Scan** the expression left to right.
> * **Push operands** onto the stack.
> * When you find an **operator**, **pop** the required number of operands from the stack, apply the operator, and **push** the result back.
> * Final result is the last value in the stack.

### ✅ Step 2: Step-by-step stack simulation (4 marks)

Expression: `1 5 7 3 - 2 ^ * +`

We process tokens one by one:

| Token | Action                      | Stack         |
| ----- | --------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1     | Operand → Push              | \[1]          |
| 5     | Operand → Push              | \[1, 5]       |
| 7     | Operand → Push              | \[1, 5, 7]    |
| 3     | Operand → Push              | \[1, 5, 7, 3] |
| -     | Operator → 7 - 3 = **4**    | \[1, 5, 4]    |
| 2     | Operand → Push              | \[1, 5, 4, 2] |
| ^     | Operator → 4 ^ 2 = **16**   | \[1, 5, 16]   |
| \*    | Operator → 5 \* 16 = **80** | \[1, 80]      |
| +     | Operator → 1 + 80 = **81**  | \[81]         |

---

### ✅ Step 3: Final Answer (1 mark)

**Final Result = 81**

---

### 🎁 Bonus Tip (if space/time allows):

> The power operator `^` means exponentiation. So `4 ^ 2 = 4² = 16`.
