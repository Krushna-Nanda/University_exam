Here you go, Krishna â€” a **clear and easy-to-remember** 6-mark-style explanation of **Hashing**, including **Hash Functions** and **Hashing Techniques**, perfect for theory questions, viva, or quick revision.

## âœ… **Hashing (Definition)**

**Hashing** is a technique to **map data of any size to a fixed-size value** called a **hash code**, using a function called a **hash function**.

This is mainly used to **store and retrieve data quickly** in structures like **hash tables**.

> ðŸŽ¯ Think of it like assigning a unique "locker number" (index) to each data item (key) based on a mathematical formula.

## ðŸ”· **Hash Function**

A **hash function** takes a key (like a number or string) and converts it into an index (position in the table).

### ðŸ”¹ Properties of a good hash function:

* **Fast to compute**
* **Uniformly distributes** keys
* **Minimizes collisions** (when two keys get the same index)

### ðŸ§  **Example Hash Function**:

```c
index = key % table_size;
```

For `key = 25` and `table_size = 10`,
`index = 25 % 10 = 5`
So, value is stored at index 5 in the hash table.

## ðŸ”· **Hashing Techniques (Collision Resolution)**

Sometimes, two keys may hash to the **same index**. This is called a **collision**. We need techniques to resolve these collisions.

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Open Addressing**

* If the slot is full, search for the next empty slot.

#### a) **Linear Probing**

* Check the next index: `(index + 1) % table_size`
* Problem: causes **clustering** (many values near each other)

#### b) **Quadratic Probing**

* Jumps in increasing squares: `(index + iÂ²) % table_size`
* Reduces clustering

#### c) **Double Hashing**

* Uses a second hash function to compute the jump

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Chaining**

* Each index in the table points to a **linked list** of values.
* All values that hash to the same index are stored in the list.

ðŸ§  Example:

```text
Index 3 â†’ [13 â†’ 23 â†’ 33]
```

Because:

* 13 % 10 = 3
* 23 % 10 = 3
* 33 % 10 = 3

## ðŸ’¡ Real Life Example:

Think of students storing bags in a locker room with 10 lockers:

* A hash function assigns locker numbers using `roll_number % 10`
* If locker 5 is full, you try the next one â†’ **linear probing**
* Or create a line of bags at locker 5 â†’ **chaining**
