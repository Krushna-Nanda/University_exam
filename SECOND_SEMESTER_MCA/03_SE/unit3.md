# Object-Oriented Design (OOD) — Detailed 16-Mark Answer

---

### 1️⃣ Introduction: What is Object-Oriented Design?

Object-Oriented Design (OOD) is a **software design approach** that models a system as a collection of **interacting objects**, each representing real-world entities. It focuses on **defining classes, objects, their attributes, behaviors (methods), and relationships** to build a modular, reusable, and maintainable system.

---

### 2️⃣ Key Concepts in OOD

* **Class:** A blueprint or template defining properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of objects.
* **Object:** An instance of a class representing a real-world entity.
* **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods into a single unit (class), hiding internal details.
* **Inheritance:** Ability to create new classes (child classes) based on existing classes (parent classes), promoting reuse.
* **Polymorphism:** Ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways.
* **Abstraction:** Hiding complex details and showing only necessary features to the user.

---

### 3️⃣ Importance of OOD

* Makes software **easier to understand and maintain**
* Supports **code reusability and scalability**
* Models **real-world problems naturally**
* Helps in managing **complex software systems** by breaking them into objects

---

### 4️⃣ OOD Process

* Define classes and their attributes
* Define methods (functions) inside classes
* Establish relationships between classes (association, inheritance, aggregation)
* Design interaction between objects

---

### 5️⃣ Example: Hospital Management System

| Class/Object | Attributes                      | Methods                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Patient      | name, age, patientID            | bookAppointment(), getHistory() |
| Doctor       | name, specialty, doctorID       | diagnose(), prescribeMedicine() |
| Appointment  | date, time, patientID, doctorID | schedule(), cancel()            |

### 6️⃣ Diagrams to Draw (Simple Class Diagram for the example)

```
+-------------------+          +---------------------+           +---------------------+
|     Patient       |          |       Doctor        |           |    Appointment      |
|-------------------|          |---------------------|           |---------------------|
| - name            |          | - name              |           | - date              |
| - age             |          | - specialty         |           | - time              |
| - patientID       |          | - doctorID          |           | - patientID         |
|-------------------|          |---------------------|           | - doctorID          |
| + bookAppointment()|          | + diagnose()        |           | + schedule()        |
| + getHistory()    |          | + prescribeMedicine()|           | + cancel()          |
+-------------------+          +---------------------+           +---------------------+

Patient "books" Appointment  
Doctor "conducts" Appointment  
```

### 7️⃣ Advantages of OOD

* **Modularity:** Objects are self-contained modules
* **Reusability:** Classes can be reused in other programs
* **Maintainability:** Easy to fix and update parts without affecting others
* **Flexibility:** Polymorphism allows flexible and dynamic behavior
* **Real-world modeling:** Intuitive design approach

---

### 8️⃣ Summary

> Object-Oriented Design (OOD) is a method to design software using objects and classes that represent real-world entities. It uses principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create modular, reusable, and maintainable software. By defining classes with attributes and methods, and their relationships, OOD helps build clear and flexible software systems, like a hospital management system where patients, doctors, and appointments are objects interacting with each other.

# Tips for Drawing the Diagram in Exam:

* Draw simple boxes for classes with 3 parts (class name, attributes, methods)
* Show relationships with lines (e.g., Patient → Appointment as "books")
* Label the lines if possible (association, aggregation)

Alright Krushna, let's crush these OOA & OOD questions with clear, simple, and exam-friendly answers — with examples and a diagram idea to help you remember easily! 💥

# 1️⃣ Why is Object-Oriented Design (OOD) preferred over Function-Oriented Design?

---

### **Answer:**

* **OOD models real-world things as objects**, bundling data and behaviors together, making software easier to understand and maintain.
* In **Function-Oriented Design (FOD)**, the focus is on functions or procedures, which can become messy as programs grow.
* OOD supports **reusability** through inheritance, **encapsulation** (data hiding), and **polymorphism** (flexible behavior).
* OOD makes it easier to handle complex systems by breaking them into interacting objects rather than separate functions.
* Example: In a hospital system, a `Patient` object has data (name, age) and methods (book appointment), while in FOD, data and functions are separate, causing scattered code.

# 2️⃣ Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) and Modeling

---

### What is OOA?

* OOA is the process of **analyzing the requirements** of the system using object-oriented concepts.
* It focuses on identifying the **objects, their attributes, behaviors, and relationships** in the problem domain before design and coding.
* The goal is to build a clear model of the system **from the user's perspective** using objects.

---

### Key Activities in OOA:

* Identify objects and classes
* Define attributes and methods
* Understand object interactions
* Use diagrams like **Use Case Diagrams, Class Diagrams**

---

### Modeling in OOA:

* **Use Case Diagram:** Shows interactions between users (actors) and the system
* **Class Diagram:** Shows objects/classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships

---

# 3️⃣ Object-Oriented Design (OOD)

---

### What is OOD?

* OOD is the **next step after OOA**, where the analysis model is converted into a **design model** ready for implementation.
* It defines the **software architecture, detailed classes, interfaces, and interactions**.
* Focuses on how objects collaborate to fulfill system requirements.

---

### Features of OOD:

* Encapsulation: Group data and functions inside classes
* Inheritance: Create new classes from existing ones
* Polymorphism: Same method name behaves differently in different classes

---

### Example: Hospital System

| Object/Class | Attributes      | Methods                         |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Patient      | name, age, id   | bookAppointment(), getHistory() |
| Doctor       | name, specialty | diagnose(), prescribeMedicine() |

---

### Diagram Idea (Class Diagram):

```
+------------------+            +-----------------+
|     Patient      |            |     Doctor      |
|------------------|            |-----------------|
| - name           |            | - name          |
| - age            |            | - specialty     |
| - id             |            |                 |
|------------------|            |-----------------|
| + bookAppointment()|          | + diagnose()    |
| + getHistory()    |           | + prescribeMedicine() |
+------------------+            +-----------------+
```

---

# Summary for Exam:

> **OOD is preferred over function-oriented design** because it models real-world entities as objects, promotes code reuse, and handles complexity better.
> **OOA** is about analyzing requirements to find objects and relationships using models like use case and class diagrams.
> **OOD** transforms analysis into a detailed design showing how objects will interact, focusing on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
