Here are the **filtered past-paper questions**, mapped **module-wise** to **your new syllabus**, so you know exactly what to study:

---

## Module-I: Introduction & Process Models

> **2024**

* **Q3.** Why are recent software industries adopting development practices like the Spiral Model while gradually removing the need for the Waterfall Model for large projects?

  * State the advantages and disadvantages of this transition. Explain with relevant examples.

> **2023**

* **Q3.** What is the Waterfall Model for software development? Explain a situation where the Spiral Model should be preferred over the Waterfall Model.

> **2022**

* **Q3.** Discuss different phases of the Iterative Waterfall Model. Compare the relative advantages of using the Iterative Waterfall Model and the Spiral Model of software development. Explain with suitable examples, the type of problems for which you would adopt the Waterfall Model and the type of problems for which you would adopt the Spiral Model.

---

## Module-II: Requirements Analysis & SRS

> **2024**

* **Q4.** What do you mean by Functional Requirements and Non-Functional Requirements in an SRS? Discuss their advantages & disadvantages. Write in detail about both types of requirements for the establishment of a hospital.

> **2023**

* **Q3.** (DFD part) A program is to be developed to simulate the operations of a scientific calculator. List the facilities to be provided by this calculator. Analyze this using a DFD (Data Flow Diagram) 0-level and 1-level diagram.

---

## Module-III: Design & Coding

> **2024**

* **Q5(a).** Define and discuss Functional Independence. Why is Functional Independence an integral factor for good software design?
