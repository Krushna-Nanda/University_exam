# 🚀 Unit 2: Requirement Analysis & Software Requirements — Powerful Summary

---

## 1️⃣ What is Requirement Analysis?

It’s the process of **understanding what users want** from software — what functions it must do and how well it should perform.

---

## 2️⃣ Problems in Requirement Elicitation (Why it’s tricky):

* Users may not know exactly what they want
* Miscommunication between users and developers
* Changing requirements during development
* Ambiguous or incomplete requirements

---

## 3️⃣ Methods of Eliciting User Requirements:

* **Interviews:** One-on-one talk to understand needs
* **Questionnaires:** Collect info from many users
* **Observation:** Watch users in action
* **Workshops:** Group discussion & brainstorming
* **Prototyping:** Show rough versions for feedback
* **Document Analysis:** Study existing documents

## 4️⃣ Types of Requirements:

| Type                    | Description                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Functional**          | What the software *must do* (e.g., login, save data)   |
| **Non-Functional**      | How well it must do (e.g., speed, security, usability) |
| **User Requirements**   | User's perspective in simple language                  |
| **System Requirements** | Detailed technical specifications                      |



## 6️⃣ Software Requirements Document (SRS)

* A detailed document with all requirements
* Acts as a contract between client and developers
* Includes functional, non-functional, constraints, use cases, diagrams

## 7️⃣ Requirements Engineering Process:

| Step                                   | Description                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Feasibility Study**                  | Can the project be done? Tech, cost, schedule? |
| **Requirement Elicitation & Analysis** | Gather and understand needs                    |
| **Requirement Validation**             | Check correctness, completeness, conflicts     |
| **Requirement Management**             | Handle changes over time, keep track           |

# ✅ **Explain DFD with Suitable Examples**

---

## 📘 **What is a DFD (Data Flow Diagram)?**

> A **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** shows **how data flows** through a system. It focuses on how **inputs are transformed into outputs** through different processes.

It **does not show program code**, only **how information moves**.

---

## 🔍 **Purpose of a DFD**

* To visually **understand and analyze the system**
* To identify **how data enters, gets processed, and where it goes**
* Useful for both **developers and non-technical stakeholders**

---

## 🔷 **DFD Components (Symbols)**

| Component           | Symbol             | Meaning                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Process**         | ○ or ▭ (round box) | A function or action (e.g., “Register Patient”) |
| **Data Flow**       | ➝ Arrow            | Movement of data (e.g., “Patient Info”)         |
| **Data Store**      | = =                | Storage (e.g., Database)                        |
| **External Entity** | □ (Square)         | Person/system outside the system (e.g., User)   |

## 📊 **Levels of DFD**

### 🔹 Level 0 DFD (Context Diagram)

* Shows **entire system as one process**
* Displays **external entities** and **data flow in/out**

### 🔹 Level 1 DFD

* Breaks the main process into **sub-processes**
* Shows **data stores and detailed data flow**
