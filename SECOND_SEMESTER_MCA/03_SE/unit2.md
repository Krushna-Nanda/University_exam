# üöÄ Unit 2: Requirement Analysis & Software Requirements ‚Äî Powerful Summary

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Requirement Analysis?

It‚Äôs the process of **understanding what users want** from software ‚Äî what functions it must do and how well it should perform.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Problems in Requirement Elicitation (Why it‚Äôs tricky):

* Users may not know exactly what they want
* Miscommunication between users and developers
* Changing requirements during development
* Ambiguous or incomplete requirements

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Methods of Eliciting User Requirements:

* **Interviews:** One-on-one talk to understand needs
* **Questionnaires:** Collect info from many users
* **Observation:** Watch users in action
* **Workshops:** Group discussion & brainstorming
* **Prototyping:** Show rough versions for feedback
* **Document Analysis:** Study existing documents

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Requirements:

| Type                    | Description                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Functional**          | What the software *must do* (e.g., login, save data)   |
| **Non-Functional**      | How well it must do (e.g., speed, security, usability) |
| **User Requirements**   | User's perspective in simple language                  |
| **System Requirements** | Detailed technical specifications                      |



## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Software Requirements Document (SRS)

* A detailed document with all requirements
* Acts as a contract between client and developers
* Includes functional, non-functional, constraints, use cases, diagrams

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Requirements Engineering Process:

| Step                                   | Description                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Feasibility Study**                  | Can the project be done? Tech, cost, schedule? |
| **Requirement Elicitation & Analysis** | Gather and understand needs                    |
| **Requirement Validation**             | Check correctness, completeness, conflicts     |
| **Requirement Management**             | Handle changes over time, keep track           |
