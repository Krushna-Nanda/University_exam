# 🚀 Unit 2: Requirement Analysis & Software Requirements — Powerful Summary

---

## 1️⃣ What is Requirement Analysis?

It’s the process of **understanding what users want** from software — what functions it must do and how well it should perform.

---

## 2️⃣ Problems in Requirement Elicitation (Why it’s tricky):

* Users may not know exactly what they want
* Miscommunication between users and developers
* Changing requirements during development
* Ambiguous or incomplete requirements

---

## 3️⃣ Methods of Eliciting User Requirements:

* **Interviews:** One-on-one talk to understand needs
* **Questionnaires:** Collect info from many users
* **Observation:** Watch users in action
* **Workshops:** Group discussion & brainstorming
* **Prototyping:** Show rough versions for feedback
* **Document Analysis:** Study existing documents

---

## 4️⃣ Types of Requirements:

| Type                    | Description                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Functional**          | What the software *must do* (e.g., login, save data)   |
| **Non-Functional**      | How well it must do (e.g., speed, security, usability) |
| **User Requirements**   | User's perspective in simple language                  |
| **System Requirements** | Detailed technical specifications                      |



## 6️⃣ Software Requirements Document (SRS)

* A detailed document with all requirements
* Acts as a contract between client and developers
* Includes functional, non-functional, constraints, use cases, diagrams

---

## 7️⃣ Requirements Engineering Process:

| Step                                   | Description                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Feasibility Study**                  | Can the project be done? Tech, cost, schedule? |
| **Requirement Elicitation & Analysis** | Gather and understand needs                    |
| **Requirement Validation**             | Check correctness, completeness, conflicts     |
| **Requirement Management**             | Handle changes over time, keep track           |

# ✅ **Explain DFD with Suitable Examples**

---

## 📘 **What is a DFD (Data Flow Diagram)?**

> A **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** shows **how data flows** through a system. It focuses on how **inputs are transformed into outputs** through different processes.

It **does not show program code**, only **how information moves**.

---

## 🔍 **Purpose of a DFD**

* To visually **understand and analyze the system**
* To identify **how data enters, gets processed, and where it goes**
* Useful for both **developers and non-technical stakeholders**

---

## 🔷 **DFD Components (Symbols)**

| Component           | Symbol             | Meaning                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Process**         | ○ or ▭ (round box) | A function or action (e.g., “Register Patient”) |
| **Data Flow**       | ➝ Arrow            | Movement of data (e.g., “Patient Info”)         |
| **Data Store**      | = =                | Storage (e.g., Database)                        |
| **External Entity** | □ (Square)         | Person/system outside the system (e.g., User)   |

---

## 📊 **Levels of DFD**

### 🔹 Level 0 DFD (Context Diagram)

* Shows **entire system as one process**
* Displays **external entities** and **data flow in/out**

### 🔹 Level 1 DFD

* Breaks the main process into **sub-processes**
* Shows **data stores and detailed data flow**

### 🧾 Your Question:

**"Describe how SRS are documented? State the importance of documentation."**
Let’s break it into two parts:

---

## 📄 **How SRS is Documented**

This was already included in the earlier combined answer — under the heading:

> ✅ **How to Prepare an SRS Document:**

Here’s the same part refined and highlighted for you again:

---

### ✍️ **Steps to Document an SRS (Proper Way)**

1. **Requirement Gathering**

   * Talk to clients, stakeholders, and users
   * Understand needs, expectations, and use cases

2. **Requirement Analysis**

   * Remove contradictions, duplications, and vague terms
   * Classify requirements (functional vs non-functional)

3. **Structuring the Document**

   * Use **IEEE 830** standard format (already explained)
   * Divide content clearly with headings and sub-headings

4. **Writing Requirements**

   * Use simple, unambiguous, and testable language
   * Number each requirement for traceability

5. **Reviewing & Validation**

   * Review with client, developers, testers
   * Confirm that all needs are covered and understood

---

## 📌 **Importance of SRS Documentation**

Also already implied under headings like **“Importance”**, **“Users of SRS”**, and **“Why SRS is important”** — but here’s a focused version:

---

### 📚 **Why SRS Documentation is Important**

1. ✅ **Foundation for Development**

   * Everything starts with SRS — it's the software blueprint

2. 🔄 **Reduces Miscommunication**

   * All stakeholders are on the same page

3. 🧪 **Basis for Testing**

   * Testers use it to design test cases for every feature

4. 💵 **Supports Cost & Time Estimation**

   * Helps project managers plan budget and schedule

5. 🔧 **Assists in Maintenance**

   * Post-delivery changes are easier with clear documentation

6. 📜 **Legal Protection**

   * SRS acts like a contract — protects both client and developer

---

### 🎯 TL;DR to write in exam:

> "SRS is documented by gathering and analyzing requirements, structuring them using IEEE format, and validating with stakeholders. Proper documentation is essential as it acts as a blueprint, reduces errors, guides testing, supports estimation, and ensures mutual understanding between client and developers."

# ---------------------------------------------------------------

> **"What are Functional and Non-Functional Requirements?"**

you should write a clean, direct answer like this 👇

---

## ✅ **Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**

---

### 🔷 **Functional Requirements:**

These are the features or functions the system **must perform**.
They describe **what the system should do**.

**Examples:**

* User can log in using email and password.
* Admin can generate reports.
* Doctor can schedule appointments.

🟢 Functional = *Action or task the system does.*

---

### 🔷 **Non-Functional Requirements:**

These describe **how the system behaves**.
They are related to **performance, security, usability**, etc.

**Examples:**

* The system should load within 2 seconds.
* Only authorized users can access patient records.
* The system should work 24/7 without crashing.

🟢 Non-functional = *Quality or condition of the system.*

---

### 📊 **Quick Comparison Table**

| Feature             | Functional Requirements   | Non-Functional Requirements            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Focus               | What the system does      | How the system performs                |
| Easy to Test?       | Yes                       | Sometimes hard to test                 |
| Type of Requirement | Business Logic / Use Case | Performance, Security, Usability, etc. |

---

### 🏥 **Hospital Example:**

**Functional:**

* Register a new patient
* Generate a bill
* Assign a doctor to a patient

**Non-Functional:**

* The app should respond within 2 seconds
* System must support 100 users at a time
* Interface should be user-friendly
