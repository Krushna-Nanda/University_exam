## âœ… **1. Review of Object-Oriented Concepts (OOP)**

Java is a **pure object-oriented language**, and follows these **4 key principles**:

| Concept           | Meaning                                             | Example                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Encapsulation** | Binding data and methods in one unit (class)        | Private fields + public getters/setters |
| **Inheritance**   | One class inherits another                          | `class A { } class B extends A { }`     |
| **Polymorphism**  | One interface, many forms                           | Method overloading/overriding           |
| **Abstraction**   | Hiding internal details, showing only functionality | Abstract classes / Interfaces           |

## âœ… **3. Java Buzzwords (Features of Java)**

| Buzzword                 | Meaning                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Simple**               | Easy to learn and write                  |
| **Object-Oriented**      | Based on OOP concepts                    |
| **Platform Independent** | Write once, run anywhere (thanks to JVM) |
| **Secure**               | No pointer abuse, runtime checks         |
| **Robust**               | Strong memory management, error handling |
| **Multithreaded**        | Supports multiple threads                |
| **Architecture Neutral** | Compiled bytecode works on any system    |
| **Portable**             | Can move code between systems easily     |
| **High Performance**     | Bytecode runs fast via JIT compiler      |
| **Interpreted**          | Bytecode is interpreted by JVM           |
| **Distributed**          | Supports network-based applications      |
| **Dynamic**              | Can load classes at runtime              |
