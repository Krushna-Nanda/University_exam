Alright Krishna, letâ€™s knock out **Module-I: Java Basics** â€” fast, clear, exam-ready! No time waste, just the juicy points you'll need to write solid answers. ðŸ§ âš¡

## âœ… **1. Review of Object-Oriented Concepts (OOP)**

Java is a **pure object-oriented language**, and follows these **4 key principles**:

| Concept           | Meaning                                             | Example                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Encapsulation** | Binding data and methods in one unit (class)        | Private fields + public getters/setters |
| **Inheritance**   | One class inherits another                          | `class A { } class B extends A { }`     |
| **Polymorphism**  | One interface, many forms                           | Method overloading/overriding           |
| **Abstraction**   | Hiding internal details, showing only functionality | Abstract classes / Interfaces           |

## âœ… **2. History of Java**

| Point             | Details                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Invented by       | **James Gosling** at Sun Microsystems        |
| Year              | **1995**                                     |
| Originally called | **Oak** (later changed to Java)              |
| Acquired by       | **Oracle Corporation** in 2010               |
| Why Java?         | Named after **Java coffee** from Indonesia â˜• |

## âœ… **3. Java Buzzwords (Features of Java)**

| Buzzword                 | Meaning                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Simple**               | Easy to learn and write                  |
| **Object-Oriented**      | Based on OOP concepts                    |
| **Platform Independent** | Write once, run anywhere (thanks to JVM) |
| **Secure**               | No pointer abuse, runtime checks         |
| **Robust**               | Strong memory management, error handling |
| **Multithreaded**        | Supports multiple threads                |
| **Architecture Neutral** | Compiled bytecode works on any system    |
| **Portable**             | Can move code between systems easily     |
| **High Performance**     | Bytecode runs fast via JIT compiler      |
| **Interpreted**          | Bytecode is interpreted by JVM           |
| **Distributed**          | Supports network-based applications      |
| **Dynamic**              | Can load classes at runtime              |

Hell yeah, Krishna! Let's crush this question so hard that if it comes in your exam, youâ€™ll blink twice and write the whole answer in one go. Here's a clean, exam-ready comparison + proper code examples ðŸ”¥

## ðŸ”· Difference Between `String` and `StringBuffer` in Java

| Feature           | `String`                      | `StringBuffer`                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Mutability**    | Immutable (cannot be changed) | Mutable (can be changed)         |
| **Performance**   | Slower for multiple changes   | Faster for multiple changes      |
| **Thread-Safety** | Not thread-safe               | Thread-safe (synchronized)       |
| **Package**       | `java.lang.String`            | `java.lang.StringBuffer`         |
| **Use Case**      | Best for fixed/constant text  | Best for dynamic/modifiable text |

---

## ðŸ”¸ String Example (Immutable)

```java
public class StringExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "Hello";
        s = s + " World";  // This creates a **new object**
        System.out.println(s); // Output: Hello World
    }
}
```

### Why Immutable?

* `"Hello"` is stored at one place, and when you add `" World"`, it **creates a new string object**.
* Old `"Hello"` still exists in memory (in the String Pool), just unused now.

---

## ðŸ”¸ StringBuffer Example (Mutable)

```java
public class StringBufferExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");
        sb.append(" World");  // Modifies the same object
        System.out.println(sb); // Output: Hello World
    }
}
```

### Why Mutable?

* `StringBuffer` allows you to **change the content of the object** without creating a new one.

## ðŸ”¥ When to Use What?

| Situation                                 | Use                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text never changes (e.g., error messages) | `String`                                                        |
| Repeated modifications (e.g., loops)      | `StringBuffer` (or `StringBuilder` if thread-safety not needed) |

---

Let me know if you want to compare `StringBuffer` with `StringBuilder` next, or dive into internal memory stuff too!
