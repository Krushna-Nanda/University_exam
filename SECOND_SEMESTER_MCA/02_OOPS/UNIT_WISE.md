1. What is compile-time polymorphism and its importance? Use compile-time polymorphism in a Java program to create objects.
2. Discuss method overloading and overriding with an example in Java.
3. With the help of Java programs, explain the different uses of the `super` keyword.
4. Discuss the methods for String comparison with examples.
5. Develop a Java package named `evenpackage`, with a class `Even` containing a static method that checks whether a number is even or not and returns that information. Import this package in another class and use it to check whether a number is even or not.
6. Discuss the opening and reading of a user-defined text file in Java with a suitable example.
7. Explain the significance of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) architecture in the context of Java programming. How does it contribute to Javaâ€™s platform independence?
8. Write a Java program that takes user input for the radius of a circle and calculates its area. Explain the process of user input, variable declaration, and mathematical calculations in your program.
9. Explain the concept of method overloading in Java with an example.
10. Discuss the concept of dynamic method dispatch in Java. Provide an example scenario involving a base class and its derived classes.
11. Explain the significance of interfaces in Java and their role in achieving multiple inheritance. Create an example interface and demonstrate how classes can implement multiple interfaces.
12. Define abstract classes in Java and explain their purpose in object-oriented programming.
