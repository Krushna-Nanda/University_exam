Bro, here’s the **straight-up truth**:

---

### Is it mandatory to make **each state complete**? (Meaning: every input symbol has a transition from every state)

**Short answer:**

* **For a proper DFA — YES, it’s mandatory.**

---

### Why?

* **By definition, a DFA must have exactly one transition for each input symbol from every state.**
  No exceptions. No “I don’t know” state.

* This means **no missing transitions allowed.**

---

### What if you don’t have a transition for some input?

* You add a **dead (trap) state** — a special state where if you land, you stay forever (loop on all inputs), and it’s non-accepting.

---

### Example:

If from state q1 you have input symbols {a, b} but only defined transition for ‘a’, then:

* Add a dead state q\_dead
* For input ‘b’ from q1, go to q\_dead
* From q\_dead, for all inputs, stay in q\_dead

### So basically:

| DFA Rule           | Explanation                                          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Complete DFA       | Every input symbol has a transition from every state |
| Missing transition | NOT allowed in DFA, must add dead state              |
| Dead state         | Non-accepting trap to catch “invalid” inputs         |

---

### TL;DR:

> If you want a **valid DFA**, you must make sure **every state is complete** with all input transitions defined, or add a dead state to handle undefined inputs.

Clear? Or want me to draw a quick DFA example with a dead state?
