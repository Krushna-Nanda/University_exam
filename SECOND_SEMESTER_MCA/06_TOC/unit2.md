## 📌 **1. Applications of Regular Expressions (6 marks)**

### ✅ **Definition:**

A **regular expression (RE)** is a symbolic representation used to describe regular languages using operations like union, concatenation, and Kleene star.

### ✅ **Applications:**

1. **Lexical Analysis (Compilers):**
   Used to define tokens like identifiers, keywords, numbers in programming languages.

2. **Pattern Matching Tools:**
   Used in tools like `grep`, `sed`, `awk` to find patterns in text.

3. **Text Editors:**
   Used in search-and-replace features in editors like VS Code, Sublime, Notepad++.

4. **Syntax Highlighting:**
   IDEs use RE to detect syntax and color-code it.

5. **Validation Tasks:**
   Used to validate email addresses, phone numbers, postal codes using RE patterns.

6. **Spam Filtering & Log Parsing:**
   RE helps in classifying content or extracting specific information.

> 📌 **Example:** Regex `^[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z]+\.[a-z]{2,}$` checks valid email format.

## 📌 **2. Algebraic Laws of Regular Expressions (6 marks)**

### ✅ **Definition:**

Algebraic laws help in simplifying and manipulating regular expressions without changing the language they represent.

### ✅ **Important Laws:**

| Law Name                | Expression                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Identity**            | R ∪ ∅ = R, R·ε = R        |
| **Annihilation**        | R ∪ Σ\* = Σ\*, R·∅ = ∅    |
| **Idempotent**          | R ∪ R = R                 |
| **Commutative (Union)** | R ∪ S = S ∪ R             |
| **Associative**         | (R ∪ S) ∪ T = R ∪ (S ∪ T) |
| **Distributive**        | R(S ∪ T) = RS ∪ RT        |
| **Kleene Laws**         | R\* = ε ∪ RR\*            |

> 📌 **Use:** These laws help simplify regular expressions and minimize finite automata.

## 📌 **3. Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages (6 marks)**

### ✅ **Definition:**

The **Pumping Lemma** provides a property that **all regular languages must satisfy**. It's mainly used to **prove that a language is *not* regular**.

### ✅ **Statement:**

For a regular language **L**, there exists a number **p** (pumping length) such that any string **w ∈ L**, with **|w| ≥ p**, can be split into **w = xyz** satisfying:

1. |y| > 0
2. |xy| ≤ p
3. For all i ≥ 0, **x(y^i)z ∈ L**

---

### ✅ **Application Example:**

To prove **L = { aⁿbⁿ | n ≥ 0 }** is not regular:

* Assume L is regular.
* Choose w = `a^p b^p`
* Split w = xyz, with |xy| ≤ p → y contains only a's
* Pump y: xyyz → more a's than b's → not in L

⚠️ **Contradiction!** So L is **not regular**.

## 📌 **4. Closure & Decision Properties of Regular Languages (6 marks)**

### ✅ **Closure Properties:**

Regular languages are **closed** under these operations (result is still regular):

| Operation     | Example                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Union         | L1 ∪ L2 is regular            |
| Concatenation | L1L2 is regular               |
| Kleene Star   | L1\* is regular               |
| Intersection  | L1 ∩ L2 is regular            |
| Complement    | Σ\* \ L1 is regular           |
| Difference    | L1 − L2 = L1 ∩ L2′ is regular |
| Reversal      | reverse(L1) is regular        |

---

### ✅ **Decision Properties:**

There exist **algorithms** to decide the following:

| Property           | Decidable? | Description              |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| Emptiness (L = ∅?) | ✅          | Is language empty?       |
| Finiteness         | ✅          | Is L finite?             |
| Membership         | ✅          | Is string `w ∈ L`?       |
| Equivalence        | ✅          | Is L1 = L2?              |
| Subset (L1 ⊆ L2?)  | ✅          | Can be decided using DFA |

---

### ✅ Real-life Use:

* Membership check = Input validation
* Equivalence = Optimizing two regexes
* Closure = Combining automata logic in compilers
