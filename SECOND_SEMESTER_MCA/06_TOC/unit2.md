## üìå **1. Applications of Regular Expressions (6 marks)**

### ‚úÖ **Definition:**

A **regular expression (RE)** is a symbolic representation used to describe regular languages using operations like union, concatenation, and Kleene star.

### ‚úÖ **Applications:**

1. **Lexical Analysis (Compilers):**
   Used to define tokens like identifiers, keywords, numbers in programming languages.

2. **Pattern Matching Tools:**
   Used in tools like `grep`, `sed`, `awk` to find patterns in text.

3. **Text Editors:**
   Used in search-and-replace features in editors like VS Code, Sublime, Notepad++.

4. **Syntax Highlighting:**
   IDEs use RE to detect syntax and color-code it.

5. **Validation Tasks:**
   Used to validate email addresses, phone numbers, postal codes using RE patterns.

6. **Spam Filtering & Log Parsing:**
   RE helps in classifying content or extracting specific information.

> üìå **Example:** Regex `^[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z]+\.[a-z]{2,}$` checks valid email format.

## üìå **2. Algebraic Laws of Regular Expressions (6 marks)**

### ‚úÖ **Definition:**

Algebraic laws help in simplifying and manipulating regular expressions without changing the language they represent.

### ‚úÖ **Important Laws:**

| Law Name                | Expression                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Identity**            | R ‚à™ ‚àÖ = R, R¬∑Œµ = R        |
| **Annihilation**        | R ‚à™ Œ£\* = Œ£\*, R¬∑‚àÖ = ‚àÖ    |
| **Idempotent**          | R ‚à™ R = R                 |
| **Commutative (Union)** | R ‚à™ S = S ‚à™ R             |
| **Associative**         | (R ‚à™ S) ‚à™ T = R ‚à™ (S ‚à™ T) |
| **Distributive**        | R(S ‚à™ T) = RS ‚à™ RT        |
| **Kleene Laws**         | R\* = Œµ ‚à™ RR\*            |

> üìå **Use:** These laws help simplify regular expressions and minimize finite automata.

## üìå **3. Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages (6 marks)**

### ‚úÖ **Definition:**

The **Pumping Lemma** provides a property that **all regular languages must satisfy**. It's mainly used to **prove that a language is *not* regular**.

### ‚úÖ **Statement:**

For a regular language **L**, there exists a number **p** (pumping length) such that any string **w ‚àà L**, with **|w| ‚â• p**, can be split into **w = xyz** satisfying:

1. |y| > 0
2. |xy| ‚â§ p
3. For all i ‚â• 0, **x(y^i)z ‚àà L**

---

### ‚úÖ **Application Example:**

To prove **L = { a‚Åøb‚Åø | n ‚â• 0 }** is not regular:

* Assume L is regular.
* Choose w = `a^p b^p`
* Split w = xyz, with |xy| ‚â§ p ‚Üí y contains only a's
* Pump y: xyyz ‚Üí more a's than b's ‚Üí not in L

‚ö†Ô∏è **Contradiction!** So L is **not regular**.

---

## üìå **4. Closure & Decision Properties of Regular Languages (6 marks)**

### ‚úÖ **Closure Properties:**

Regular languages are **closed** under these operations (result is still regular):

| Operation     | Example                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Union         | L1 ‚à™ L2 is regular            |
| Concatenation | L1L2 is regular               |
| Kleene Star   | L1\* is regular               |
| Intersection  | L1 ‚à© L2 is regular            |
| Complement    | Œ£\* \ L1 is regular           |
| Difference    | L1 ‚àí L2 = L1 ‚à© L2‚Ä≤ is regular |
| Reversal      | reverse(L1) is regular        |

---

### ‚úÖ **Decision Properties:**

There exist **algorithms** to decide the following:

| Property           | Decidable? | Description              |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| Emptiness (L = ‚àÖ?) | ‚úÖ          | Is language empty?       |
| Finiteness         | ‚úÖ          | Is L finite?             |
| Membership         | ‚úÖ          | Is string `w ‚àà L`?       |
| Equivalence        | ‚úÖ          | Is L1 = L2?              |
| Subset (L1 ‚äÜ L2?)  | ‚úÖ          | Can be decided using DFA |

---

### ‚úÖ Real-life Use:

* Membership check = Input validation
* Equivalence = Optimizing two regexes
* Closure = Combining automata logic in compilers

Need visual automata examples for any of these? Ya thoda coding jaise conversion? Bol bhai ‚Äî beast mode ON hai üî•

Let‚Äôs go, Krishna! üî•
Here‚Äôs the **FULL step-by-step answer** using **Pumping Lemma** to **prove** that the language:

> **L = { a‚Åøb‚Åø | n ‚â• 0 }**

is **not regular**.

---

## üìù Question:

**Prove that L = { a‚Åøb‚Åø | n ‚â• 0 } is not regular using the Pumping Lemma.**

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Answer:

### üî∑ Step 1: Assume L is regular

Assume, for contradiction, that **L is regular**.
Then, according to the **Pumping Lemma**, there exists a **pumping length** `p` such that every string `w ‚àà L` with length ‚â• `p` can be split into 3 parts:

> **w = xyz**, satisfying:
>
> 1. **|y| > 0**
> 2. **|xy| ‚â§ p**
> 3. For all **i ‚â• 0**, **xy‚Å±z ‚àà L**

---

### üî∑ Step 2: Choose a specific string w ‚àà L

Let‚Äôs choose:

> **w = a^p b^p** (i.e., p a‚Äôs followed by p b‚Äôs)

Clearly:

* **|w| = 2p ‚â• p**
* **w ‚àà L**

---

### üî∑ Step 3: Consider any possible split w = xyz

By the Pumping Lemma:

* **|xy| ‚â§ p** ‚áí So **x and y consist only of a‚Äôs**
  (Because first `p` symbols are all **a‚Äôs**)
* **|y| > 0** ‚áí y = a·µè, where **k > 0**

So:

* Let‚Äôs say:

  * **x = a·µê**
  * **y = a·µè**
  * So **xy = a^(m + k)** where m + k ‚â§ p
* z = a^(p ‚àí m ‚àí k) b^p

So:

> **xyz = a^p b^p ‚úÖ** (the original string)

---

### üî∑ Step 4: Pump the string (take i = 2)

Now apply **pumping** with **i = 2**:

> **xy¬≤z = xyyz = a·µê (a·µè)(a·µè) a^(p ‚àí m ‚àí k) b^p**

‚Üí Combine all the a‚Äôs:

* a·µê + a·µè + a·µè + a^(p ‚àí m ‚àí k)
  \= a^(p + k)

So:

> **xy¬≤z = a^(p + k) b^p**

---

### üî∑ Step 5: Show contradiction

Now we have:

* a‚Äôs = p + k
* b‚Äôs = p

But this is **not** of the form **a‚Åøb‚Åø** because:

> **Number of a‚Äôs ‚â† number of b‚Äôs** ‚ùå

So:

> **xy¬≤z ‚àâ L**

---

### üî∑ Step 6: Conclusion

This contradicts the Pumping Lemma, which says **xy‚Å±z must be in L for all i ‚â• 0**

### ‚ùå Contradiction ‚áí Our assumption was wrong!

---

## ‚úÖ Final Conclusion:

> The language **L = { a‚Åøb‚Åø | n ‚â• 0 } is not regular.**
> Hence, it **cannot be accepted by any finite automaton**.
