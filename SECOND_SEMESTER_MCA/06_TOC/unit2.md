## 📌 **1. Applications of Regular Expressions (6 marks)**

### ✅ **Definition:**

A **regular expression (RE)** is a symbolic representation used to describe regular languages using operations like union, concatenation, and Kleene star.

### ✅ **Applications:**

1. **Lexical Analysis (Compilers):**
   Used to define tokens like identifiers, keywords, numbers in programming languages.

2. **Pattern Matching Tools:**
   Used in tools like `grep`, `sed`, `awk` to find patterns in text.

3. **Text Editors:**
   Used in search-and-replace features in editors like VS Code, Sublime, Notepad++.

4. **Syntax Highlighting:**
   IDEs use RE to detect syntax and color-code it.

5. **Validation Tasks:**
   Used to validate email addresses, phone numbers, postal codes using RE patterns.

6. **Spam Filtering & Log Parsing:**
   RE helps in classifying content or extracting specific information.

> 📌 **Example:** Regex `^[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z]+\.[a-z]{2,}$` checks valid email format.

## 📌 **2. Algebraic Laws of Regular Expressions (6 marks)**

### ✅ **Definition:**

Algebraic laws help in simplifying and manipulating regular expressions without changing the language they represent.

### ✅ **Important Laws:**

| Law Name                | Expression                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Identity**            | R ∪ ∅ = R, R·ε = R        |
| **Annihilation**        | R ∪ Σ\* = Σ\*, R·∅ = ∅    |
| **Idempotent**          | R ∪ R = R                 |
| **Commutative (Union)** | R ∪ S = S ∪ R             |
| **Associative**         | (R ∪ S) ∪ T = R ∪ (S ∪ T) |
| **Distributive**        | R(S ∪ T) = RS ∪ RT        |
| **Kleene Laws**         | R\* = ε ∪ RR\*            |

> 📌 **Use:** These laws help simplify regular expressions and minimize finite automata.

## 📌 **3. Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages (6 marks)**

### ✅ **Definition:**

The **Pumping Lemma** provides a property that **all regular languages must satisfy**. It's mainly used to **prove that a language is *not* regular**.

### ✅ **Statement:**

For a regular language **L**, there exists a number **p** (pumping length) such that any string **w ∈ L**, with **|w| ≥ p**, can be split into **w = xyz** satisfying:

1. |y| > 0
2. |xy| ≤ p
3. For all i ≥ 0, **x(y^i)z ∈ L**

---

### ✅ **Application Example:**

To prove **L = { aⁿbⁿ | n ≥ 0 }** is not regular:

* Assume L is regular.
* Choose w = `a^p b^p`
* Split w = xyz, with |xy| ≤ p → y contains only a's
* Pump y: xyyz → more a's than b's → not in L

⚠️ **Contradiction!** So L is **not regular**.

## 📌 **4. Closure & Decision Properties of Regular Languages (6 marks)**

### ✅ **Closure Properties:**

Regular languages are **closed** under these operations (result is still regular):

| Operation     | Example                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Union         | L1 ∪ L2 is regular            |
| Concatenation | L1L2 is regular               |
| Kleene Star   | L1\* is regular               |
| Intersection  | L1 ∩ L2 is regular            |
| Complement    | Σ\* \ L1 is regular           |
| Difference    | L1 − L2 = L1 ∩ L2′ is regular |
| Reversal      | reverse(L1) is regular        |

---

### ✅ **Decision Properties:**

There exist **algorithms** to decide the following:

| Property           | Decidable? | Description              |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| Emptiness (L = ∅?) | ✅          | Is language empty?       |
| Finiteness         | ✅          | Is L finite?             |
| Membership         | ✅          | Is string `w ∈ L`?       |
| Equivalence        | ✅          | Is L1 = L2?              |
| Subset (L1 ⊆ L2?)  | ✅          | Can be decided using DFA |

---

### ✅ Real-life Use:

* Membership check = Input validation
* Equivalence = Optimizing two regexes
* Closure = Combining automata logic in compilers

## 💻 Regular Language Operations – Full Table Style with Real Examples

---

### 🔹 1. **Union** – `L1 ∪ L2`

➡️ "Either this OR that"

**Example**:

* L1 = strings with only a & b → `(a + b)*`
* L2 = strings with only c & d → `(c + d)*`
* `L = L1 ∪ L2`

✅ Accepts:

```
"abba", "b", "", "ccd", "ddc", "c"
```

❌ Rejects:

```
"abc", "adc", "cad", "ac"
```

---

### 🔹 2. **Concatenation** – `L1 · L2`

➡️ "First something from L1, then from L2"

**Example**:

* L1 = `(a + b)*` = strings of a’s and b’s
* L2 = `(c + d)*` = strings of c’s and d’s
* `L = L1 · L2`

✅ Accepts:

```
"ab", "abcd", "bbccdd", "aacc"
(First part: only a/b, then c/d)
```

❌ Rejects:

```
"cdab", "ccabba", "abcabc"  
(violates the order: a/b must come first)
```

---

### 🔹 3. **Kleene Star** – `L*`

➡️ "Zero or more repetitions of strings from L"

**Example**:

* L = `"ab"`
* Then `L*` = {"", "ab", "abab", "ababab", ...}

✅ Accepts:

```
"", "ab", "abab", "ababab"
```

❌ Rejects:

```
"a", "abb", "aabb", "ba"
(not full repetitions of `"ab"`)
```

---

### 🔹 4. **Intersection** – `L1 ∩ L2`

➡️ "Only strings common to both"

**Example**:

* L1 = strings ending with `a`: `(a + b)*a`
* L2 = strings starting with `a`: `a(a + b)*`

✅ Accepts:

```
"a", "aba", "aa", "abba"
(Starts and ends with a)
```

❌ Rejects:

```
"b", "ab", "bb", "baa", "bab"
```

---

### 🔹 5. **Complement** – `Σ* \ L1`

➡️ "Everything except what's in L1"

**Example**:

* Let L1 = strings that contain only even number of a's

Then:

* Complement = strings with **odd number of a's**

✅ Accepts:

```
"a", "aba", "aaaba", "aaaaa"
```

❌ Rejects:

```
"", "aa", "abba", "aabb" (even number of a's)
```

---

### 🔹 6. **Difference** – `L1 − L2` = L1 ∩ (complement of L2)

➡️ "In L1 but not in L2"

**Example**:

* L1 = all strings over {a,b} → `(a + b)*`
* L2 = strings ending with `b`

Then `L1 - L2` = strings that **do NOT end with b**

✅ Accepts:

```
"a", "aa", "aba", "babaa"
```

❌ Rejects:

```
"b", "ab", "aab", "bb"
```

---

### 🔹 7. **Reversal** – `reverse(L1)`

➡️ "Flip all strings from L1"

**Example**:

* L1 = {"ab", "abc", "baba"}
* Reverse(L1) = {"ba", "cba", "abab"}

✅ Accepts:

```
"ba", "cba", "abab"
```

❌ Rejects:

```
"ab", "abc", "baba"
(original strings, not reversed)
```

| Difference    | In L1 but not in L2  | `all - end with b`            | `"aa"`, `"aba"`    | `"ab"`, `"b"`       |
| Reversal      | Flip the string      | Reverse of `"ab"` is `"ba"`   | `"ba"`             | `"ab"`              |

## 😎 Krishna Bhai Ka Exam Tip:

> Agar question aaye: **“Is X closed under operation Y?”** — just remember:
>
> **Regular languages are total chads 💪 — closed under all these operations.**
