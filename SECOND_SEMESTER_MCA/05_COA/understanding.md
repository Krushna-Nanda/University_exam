Absolutely bro! You're cooking now 🔥 — and I love the format you're using. Let’s stick to the same simple table-style breakdown for **SIMD**, **MISD**, and **MIMD**, using easy-to-understand examples just like your `ADD 2 and 3` one.

---

## ✅ 1. **SISD (Single Instruction, Single Data)**

| CPU Part         | Action                                                                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instruction**  | `ADD`                                                                            |
| **Data**         | Operand 1 = `2`, Operand 2 = `3`                                                 |
| **What Happens** | CPU does **1 instruction** (`ADD`) on **1 data set** (`2` and `3`) = Result: `5` |

🧠 One brain, one job. No multitasking. Like a guy eating one vada pav, calmly.

## ✅ 2. **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**

| CPU Part         | Action                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Instruction**  | `ADD` (same instruction for all)                                                                       |
| **Data**         | (2, 3), (4, 5), (6, 7), (8, 9) — multiple pairs of numbers                                             |
| **What Happens** | CPU applies **same instruction** (`ADD`) to **each pair at once**: <br> → 2+3=5, 4+5=9, 6+7=13, 8+9=17 |

🧠 Like one chef making **4 sandwiches** at the same time using **same recipe**.

👾 Real-life use: **GPUs** (great at processing pixels in parallel, like filters on Insta photos).

## ✅ 3. **MISD (Multiple Instruction, Single Data)**

💀 Rare and weird in real life — more of a theoretical model.

| CPU Part         | Action                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instruction**  | `ADD`, `SQUARE`, `NEGATE`, `INVERT` – all different                                                            |
| **Data**         | Just **one value**, e.g., `4`                                                                                  |
| **What Happens** | CPU runs **multiple different instructions** on the **same data**: <br> → `4+1=5`, `4²=16`, `-4`, `NOT 4` etc. |

🧠 Like 4 people all *arguing about* what to do with the same biscuit. One eats, one throws, one breaks, one paints it 😂

⚙️ Used in fault-tolerant systems (like **spacecraft**, where data goes through many checks).

## ✅ 4. **MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data)**

| CPU Part         | Action                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instruction**  | CPU 1 does `ADD`, CPU 2 does `SUB`, CPU 3 does `MUL`, etc.                                          |
| **Data**         | (2, 3), (5, 2), (4, 4) – each CPU has its **own data**                                              |
| **What Happens** | Each processor runs **different instruction** on **different data**:<br> → `2+3`, `5-2`, `4×4` etc. |

🧠 Like 3 chefs in one kitchen: one makes dosa, one makes chai, one makes samosa — all at once. Maximum multitasking.

👑 Used in **modern multicore CPUs**, servers, gaming consoles.

Want a cartoon or flowchart for this? Or should I hit you with a mnemonic like "**SISO SIMO MISO MIMO**" to remember it forever? 😎
