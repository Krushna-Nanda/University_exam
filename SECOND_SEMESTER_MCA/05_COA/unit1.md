### ‚úÖ **Definition:**

**Computer Architecture** is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system. It defines how the computer's hardware components interact to execute instructions.

### üß© **Main Components of Basic Computer Architecture:**

1. **Input Unit**

   * Accepts data and instructions from the user.
   * Converts them into a machine-readable format.

2. **Memory Unit**

   * Stores data and instructions temporarily or permanently.
   * Two types:

     * **Primary Memory** (RAM, ROM)
     * **Secondary Memory** (Hard disk, SSD)

3. **Control Unit (CU)**

   * Manages and controls the operations of all units.
   * Fetches and decodes instructions.

4. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**

   * Performs all arithmetic and logical operations.

5. **Registers**

   * Small, high-speed memory inside the CPU used for temporary data storage.

6. **Output Unit**

   * Converts processed data into human-readable form.
   * Sends it to output devices (e.g., monitor, printer).

7. **System Bus**

   * A communication system that transfers data between components.
   * Types: **Data Bus, Address Bus, Control Bus**
