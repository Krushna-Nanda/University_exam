## ✅ **(d) Explain the Memory Interleaving Technique with Suitable Example** (6 Marks)

### ✍️ Definition:

Memory interleaving is a technique used to **speed up memory access** by dividing memory into **multiple banks** that can be accessed **simultaneously**.

Instead of accessing memory one block at a time, interleaving allows the **CPU to read/write in parallel**, reducing waiting time and improving performance.

---

### 💡 Example:

Suppose we have **4 memory banks**: Bank 0, Bank 1, Bank 2, Bank 3.

If the CPU wants to access memory addresses:
`100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105...`

With interleaving, memory is assigned like this:

| Address | Memory Bank |
| ------- | ----------- |
| 100     | Bank 0      |
| 101     | Bank 1      |
| 102     | Bank 2      |
| 103     | Bank 3      |
| 104     | Bank 0      |
| 105     | Bank 1      |

While Bank 0 is handling address 100, Bank 1 can handle 101 at the same time — this increases **parallelism** and **access speed**.

---

### ✅ Advantages:

* Faster access time
* Better CPU-memory coordination
* Reduces memory bottleneck in pipelined processors

## ✅ **(i) Define Demand Paging. Explain the Various Page Replacement Techniques** (6 or 8 Marks)

### ✍️ Definition of Demand Paging:

Demand paging is a memory management technique where **pages are loaded into RAM only when they are needed**, not in advance.

* Initially, only **essential pages** are loaded.
* When a page is accessed that’s not in memory, a **page fault** occurs.
* The OS brings the page from disk to memory.

This saves memory and allows running large programs on limited RAM.

---

### 📌 **Page Replacement Techniques:**

When memory is full and a new page needs to be loaded, one of the old pages must be **replaced**. These are the main algorithms:

---

### 1. **FIFO (First-In First-Out):**

* Oldest loaded page is removed first.
* Simple but may remove important pages.

🔁 Example: Pages loaded in order → 1, 2, 3 → Page 1 is replaced first.

---

### 2. **LRU (Least Recently Used):**

* Replaces the page that hasn’t been used for the longest time.
* Based on recent usage history.

🔁 Example: If page 3 hasn’t been used recently, it gets replaced.

---

### 3. **Optimal Replacement:**

* Replaces the page that **won’t be used for the longest time in future**.
* Theoretical best, but needs future knowledge (not practical).

---

### 4. **Clock Algorithm (Second Chance):**

* Pages are arranged in a circle like a clock.
* Each page has a reference bit.
* If bit = 0 → replace it; if bit = 1 → give second chance (bit reset).

---

### ✅ Summary:

| Technique | Strategy                         | Notes                     |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| FIFO      | Oldest page is removed first     | Simple, not always smart  |
| LRU       | Least recently used page removed | Accurate, costly to track |
| Optimal   | Page not needed for longest time | Ideal, but theoretical    |
| Clock     | Second chance to pages           | Efficient & practical     |
