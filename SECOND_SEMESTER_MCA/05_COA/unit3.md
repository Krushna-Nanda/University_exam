## ✅ **(d) Explain the Memory Interleaving Technique with Suitable Example** (6 Marks)

### ✍️ Definition:

Memory interleaving is a technique used to **speed up memory access** by dividing memory into **multiple banks** that can be accessed **simultaneously**.

Instead of accessing memory one block at a time, interleaving allows the **CPU to read/write in parallel**, reducing waiting time and improving performance.

---

### 💡 Example:

Suppose we have **4 memory banks**: Bank 0, Bank 1, Bank 2, Bank 3.

If the CPU wants to access memory addresses:
`100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105...`

With interleaving, memory is assigned like this:

| Address | Memory Bank |
| ------- | ----------- |
| 100     | Bank 0      |
| 101     | Bank 1      |
| 102     | Bank 2      |
| 103     | Bank 3      |
| 104     | Bank 0      |
| 105     | Bank 1      |

While Bank 0 is handling address 100, Bank 1 can handle 101 at the same time — this increases **parallelism** and **access speed**.

---

---
Great question, Krishna! Let’s make the **memory interleaving example** crystal clear with a **real-life analogy**, a **clean step-by-step explanation**, and **visual layout**.

---

### 💡 First, understand the problem:

* When **CPU accesses memory**, it has to **wait** if memory is busy.
* This waiting slows down performance.

So, **memory interleaving** was invented to **divide memory into banks** and allow **parallel access**.

---

### 🔧 Real-Life Analogy: "Tiffin Box Servers" 🍱

Imagine a school canteen with:

* **1 CPU = hungry student**
* **Memory = canteen staff**
* Without interleaving → **1 server**, big line = slow service
* With interleaving → **4 servers (Bank 0–3)** serving students in rotation = fast service

---

### 🧠 Technical View:

You have **4 memory banks**:

* Bank 0, Bank 1, Bank 2, Bank 3

And you need to access **addresses**:
`100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107`

---

### 🗂 How Interleaving Works:

Each **address** is **mapped** to a memory bank like this:

```plaintext
Address % Number_of_Banks = Bank_Number
```

👉 We have 4 banks, so:

```plaintext
100 % 4 = 0 → Bank 0  
101 % 4 = 1 → Bank 1  
102 % 4 = 2 → Bank 2  
103 % 4 = 3 → Bank 3  
104 % 4 = 0 → Bank 0  
105 % 4 = 1 → Bank 1  
106 % 4 = 2 → Bank 2  
107 % 4 = 3 → Bank 3  
```

---

### ✅ Final Table:

| Memory Address | Assigned Bank |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| 100            | Bank 0        |
| 101            | Bank 1        |
| 102            | Bank 2        |
| 103            | Bank 3        |
| 104            | Bank 0        |
| 105            | Bank 1        |
| 106            | Bank 2        |
| 107            | Bank 3        |

---

### 🔄 What Happens in Parallel?

While:

* **Bank 0** handles 100
* **Bank 1** handles 101
* **Bank 2** handles 102
* **Bank 3** handles 103

👉 All these banks work **simultaneously** → 4x faster!

---

### 🎯 Final Line:

So instead of **waiting for one memory block at a time**, memory interleaving lets the CPU access **multiple addresses in parallel**, one in each bank — this is how it **boosts speed**.

## ✅ **(i) Define Demand Paging. Explain the Various Page Replacement Techniques** (6 or 8 Marks)

### ✍️ Definition of Demand Paging:

Demand paging is a memory management technique where **pages are loaded into RAM only when they are needed**, not in advance.

* Initially, only **essential pages** are loaded.
* When a page is accessed that’s not in memory, a **page fault** occurs.
* The OS brings the page from disk to memory.

This saves memory and allows running large programs on limited RAM.

---

### 📌 **Page Replacement Techniques:**

When memory is full and a new page needs to be loaded, one of the old pages must be **replaced**. These are the main algorithms:

---

### 1. **FIFO (First-In First-Out):**

* Oldest loaded page is removed first.
* Simple but may remove important pages.

🔁 Example: Pages loaded in order → 1, 2, 3 → Page 1 is replaced first.

---

### 2. **LRU (Least Recently Used):**

* Replaces the page that hasn’t been used for the longest time.
* Based on recent usage history.

🔁 Example: If page 3 hasn’t been used recently, it gets replaced.

---

### 3. **Optimal Replacement:**

* Replaces the page that **won’t be used for the longest time in future**.
* Theoretical best, but needs future knowledge (not practical).

---

### 4. **Clock Algorithm (Second Chance):**

* Pages are arranged in a circle like a clock.
* Each page has a reference bit.
* If bit = 0 → replace it; if bit = 1 → give second chance (bit reset).

---

### ✅ Summary:

| Technique | Strategy                         | Notes                     |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| FIFO      | Oldest page is removed first     | Simple, not always smart  |
| LRU       | Least recently used page removed | Accurate, costly to track |
| Optimal   | Page not needed for longest time | Ideal, but theoretical    |
| Clock     | Second chance to pages           | Efficient & practical     |
