### ‚úçÔ∏è **Introduction: Flynn‚Äôs Taxonomy**

* Parallel architecture means multiple processors work together to do tasks faster.
* To understand these systems, Flynn‚Äôs Taxonomy classifies them based on:

  * **Instruction stream:** sequence of instructions sent to processors
  * **Data stream:** sequence of data being processed
* Using these, Flynn defined 4 types of architectures, which is the most used model to understand parallel computers.

---

#### ‚û§ 1. SISD (Single Instruction, Single Data)

* This is the simplest form of architecture.
* A **single processor** executes one instruction at a time on a single piece of data.
* These systems work sequentially and are used in basic microprocessors.
* **Example**: 8085 microprocessor, single-core systems.

---

#### ‚û§ 2. SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)

* A single instruction operates on **multiple data elements** in parallel.
* It is useful for tasks like image processing or matrix operations.
* This type of architecture is used in **vector and graphics processors**.
* **Example**: GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), vector processors.

---

#### ‚û§ 3. MISD (Multiple Instruction, Single Data)

* Multiple instructions are executed on the **same data item**.
* This type is extremely rare and mostly used in **fault-tolerant systems**.
* It increases reliability by using different methods to process the same data.
* **Example**: Redundant systems in aerospace or defense.

---

#### ‚û§ 4. MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data)

* Multiple processors work independently on different data with different instructions.
* This is the most common architecture used in modern multiprocessors.
* **Example**: Multicore CPUs like Intel i7, AMD Ryzen, supercomputers.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è **2. Centralized Shared Memory Architecture**

* In this architecture, all processors **share a single common memory**.
* The memory is accessed through a **shared bus** or interconnection system.
* It provides a **uniform memory model**, where all processors can access data directly.
* This model is easier to program and manage.

**Example**: Dual-core or quad-core processors using shared RAM.

**Advantages**:

* Simple to design and program.
* Fast communication among processors (for small systems).

**Disadvantages**:

* As more processors are added, the **bus becomes a bottleneck**.
* **Limited scalability**, suitable only for small multiprocessor systems.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è **3. Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) Architecture**

* In this system, each processor has **its own private memory**.
* Processors communicate with each other using **message passing**.
* However, the system provides a **shared memory abstraction** using software.

**Example**: Cluster computers, cloud-based parallel systems.

**Advantages**:

* **Highly scalable** ‚Äî works well even with hundreds of processors.
* Reduces traffic on a single memory bus.

**Disadvantages**:

* **Memory consistency** becomes harder to maintain.
* Data access may be slower due to network communication.

## ‚úÖ **4. Differences Between Centralized and Distributed Shared Memory**

### ‚û§ Centralized Shared Memory:

* One global memory shared by all processors.
* Easier to program.
* Suitable for small-scale systems.
* Memory access is faster but not scalable.

### ‚û§ Distributed Shared Memory:

* Each processor has its own memory.
* Communication is done through messages.
* Suitable for large-scale, distributed systems.
* More complex, but scalable.

---

## ‚úÖ **Conclusion**

Flynn‚Äôs taxonomy helps us understand the different types of parallel architectures based on instruction and data streams. Among these, **MIMD** is the most widely used today.
When designing multiprocessor systems, we choose between **centralized shared memory** (simple but limited) and **distributed shared memory** (complex but scalable), depending on the system's size and performance needs.
