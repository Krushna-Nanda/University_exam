### UNIT – 1: Introduction to DBMS

#### **1. File System vs. DBMS**
- **File System**:
  - Stores data in separate files.
  - Data is processed manually or using programming languages.
  - Example: Text files, spreadsheets.
  - Issues:
    - **Data Redundancy**: Same data stored in multiple files.
    - **Data Inconsistency**: Different files may have conflicting data.
    - **No Data Security**: Difficult to restrict access.
    - **Limited Query Capability**: Cannot run complex queries.

- **DBMS (Database Management System)**:
  - Software for managing and querying structured data.
  - Centralized storage of data, reducing redundancy and inconsistency.
  - Provides tools for secure, efficient data access.

  **Advantages of DBMS over File System**:
  - **Reduced Redundancy**: Data is stored only once.
  - **Consistency**: Single source of truth.
  - **Data Security**: Controlled access to sensitive data.
  - **Efficient Queries**: Powerful query languages like SQL.
  - **Data Integrity**: Enforces rules to maintain valid data.
  - **Concurrency Control**: Multiple users can access data safely.

---

#### **2. Storing Data and Queries**
- **Storing Data**: Data is stored in tables (rows and columns) within databases.
- **Queries**: Instructions to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data. Examples:
  - `SELECT` retrieves data.
  - `INSERT` adds new records.

---

#### **3. DBMS Structure**
- DBMS has layers that manage storage, query execution, and data retrieval:
  1. **Application Layer**: User interface for interacting with the DBMS.
  2. **Query Processor**: Converts user queries into low-level instructions.
  3. **Storage Manager**: Manages the physical storage of data on disk.

---

#### **4. Types of Databases**
- **Hierarchical Database**:
  - Data is organized like a tree with parent-child relationships.
  - Example: File systems, where folders contain subfolders/files.

- **Network Database**:
  - Data is organized as a graph, allowing many-to-many relationships.
  - Example: Transport networks.

- **Relational Database**:
  - Data is stored in tables with rows and columns.
  - Relationships are managed using keys.
  - Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL.

- **Key-Value Database**:
  - Simple storage of key-value pairs.
  - Example: Redis, DynamoDB.

- **Object-Oriented Database**:
  - Data is stored as objects with attributes and methods.
  - Example: db4o, ObjectDB.

- **XML Database**:
  - Stores and retrieves data in XML format.
  - Example: BaseX, MarkLogic.

---

#### **5. File Structures in Database**
- Databases organize data in various file structures for efficiency:
  - **Heap Files**: Unordered data storage.
  - **Indexed Files**: Uses indexes for faster searching.
  - **Hashed Files**: Hash functions for quick lookups.

---

#### **6. 3-Schema Architecture of DBMS**
1. **External Schema**:
   - User's view of the data.
   - Tailored for specific users or applications.
2. **Conceptual Schema**:
   - Logical structure of the database.
   - Defines tables, relationships, and constraints.
3. **Internal Schema**:
   - Physical storage of data.
   - How data is stored on the hardware.

---

#### **7. Data Independence**
- Ability to change schema levels without affecting others:
  - **Logical Data Independence**: Changes in conceptual schema don’t affect external schema.
  - **Physical Data Independence**: Changes in physical schema don’t affect conceptual schema.

---

#### **8. E.F. Codd's Rules**
Codd proposed 12 rules for relational databases to ensure consistency:
1. **Information Rule**: Data stored in tables.
2. **Guaranteed Access Rule**: Every value is accessible via table name, primary key, and column.
3. **Systematic Treatment of Nulls**: Support null values for missing data.
4. **Dynamic Online Catalog**: Metadata stored in the database.
5. **Comprehensive Data Sub-Language**: Supports SQL-like queries.
6. **View Updating Rule**: Views should reflect base table updates.
7. **High-Level Insert, Update, Delete**: Data manipulation operations are supported.
8. **Physical Data Independence**: Physical storage changes don’t affect logic.
9. **Logical Data Independence**: Schema changes don’t affect applications.
10. **Integrity Independence**: Constraints are separate from application logic.
11. **Distribution Independence**: Location of data is transparent.
12. **Non-Subversion Rule**: Only authorized users can modify the database.

Would you like to dive deeper into any specific topic?


Before learning the **ER (Entity-Relationship) Model**, there are a few basic terms you should understand. Let's explain each term with **real-world examples** so they’re easy to grasp.

---

### **1. Entity**
- **Definition**: An entity is an object, person, place, event, or thing in the real world that can be distinctly identified.
- **Examples**:
  - **In a School System**: "Student," "Teacher," "Course."
  - **In an Online Store**: "Customer," "Order," "Product."

  **Think**: An entity is like a noun.

---

### **2. Attribute**
- **Definition**: Attributes are properties or characteristics of an entity.
- **Examples**:
  - **For a Student**:
    - Name
    - Roll Number
    - Age
    - Address
  - **For a Product**:
    - Product ID
    - Name
    - Price
    - Category

  **Think**: Attributes describe the details of an entity.

---

### **3. Entity Set**
- **Definition**: A collection of similar types of entities.
- **Examples**:
  - All students in a school make up a "Student" entity set.
  - All products in a store make up a "Product" entity set.

  **Think**: It’s a group of entities of the same type.

---

### **4. Relationship**
- **Definition**: A connection or association between two or more entities.
- **Examples**:
  - **In a School**:
    - A "Student" **enrolls in** a "Course."
    - A "Teacher" **teaches** a "Course."
  - **In a Store**:
    - A "Customer" **places** an "Order."
    - An "Order" **contains** a "Product."

  **Think**: Relationships describe how entities interact with each other.

---

### **5. Relationship Set**
- **Definition**: A collection of similar relationships.
- **Example**:
  - All the "enrollments" of students in courses form a relationship set.

---

### **6. Key**
- **Definition**: An attribute (or combination of attributes) that uniquely identifies an entity.
- **Examples**:
  - **Primary Key**:
    - "Roll Number" uniquely identifies a "Student."
    - "Product ID" uniquely identifies a "Product."
  - **Foreign Key**:
    - A reference to a primary key in another table.
    - Example: "Student ID" in the "Enrollment" table refers to a "Student."

---

### **7. Cardinality**
- **Definition**: Specifies the number of entities involved in a relationship.
- **Types**:
  1. **One-to-One (1:1)**: One entity is related to only one other entity.
     - Example: A "Student" has **one** "Library Card."
  2. **One-to-Many (1:N)**: One entity is related to multiple entities.
     - Example: A "Teacher" teaches **many** "Courses."
  3. **Many-to-Many (M:N)**: Many entities are related to many others.
     - Example: "Students" enroll in **many** "Courses," and "Courses" have **many** "Students."

---

### **8. Entity vs. Attribute**
| **Entity**              | **Attribute**                  |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Represents a real-world object or concept. | Represents a property of the entity. |
| Example: "Student"       | Example: "Name," "Roll Number" |

---

### **Real-World Example**
Let’s design a **School Database** using these terms:

1. **Entities**:
   - **Student**
   - **Teacher**
   - **Course**

2. **Attributes**:
   - For **Student**: Student ID, Name, Age, Address.
   - For **Teacher**: Teacher ID, Name, Subject.
   - For **Course**: Course ID, Title, Credits.

3. **Relationships**:
   - A **Student** **enrolls in** a **Course**.
   - A **Teacher** **teaches** a **Course**.

4. **Keys**:
   - **Student ID** is the primary key for the "Student" entity.
   - **Course ID** is the primary key for the "Course" entity.

---

Would you like to try sketching an ER diagram for this example?

Sure, let’s break down all the **keys** in the simplest, most casual way possible. Think of them as tools to manage and identify data in a database. Here’s the list:

---

### **1. Primary Key**
- **What it does**: It’s like a unique ID card for every record in a table. No duplicates allowed!
- **Example**: 
  - In a "Student" table, the "Roll Number" is the primary key. Each student has a unique roll number.
- **Why it’s important**: It helps you identify each record easily.

---

### **2. Foreign Key**
- **What it does**: Think of it as a "link" between two tables. It connects one table to another using a key from the second table.
- **Example**: 
  - In an "Enrollment" table, the "Student ID" is a foreign key that connects to the "Student" table’s primary key.
- **Why it’s important**: It’s used to build relationships between tables.

---

### **3. Candidate Key**
- **What it does**: These are all the columns that *could* be the primary key. You choose the best one as the primary key.
- **Example**: 
  - In a "Student" table, both "Roll Number" and "Email" might be unique. Either could be a candidate key.
- **Why it’s important**: It gives you options to pick the primary key.

---

### **4. Composite Key**
- **What it does**: Sometimes, you need more than one column to make a unique ID. Combine them to form a composite key.
- **Example**: 
  - In an "Order" table, "Order ID" + "Product ID" together make a unique combination.
- **Why it’s important**: When one column alone isn’t unique, this saves the day!

---

### **5. Alternate Key**
- **What it does**: These are candidate keys that didn’t get chosen as the primary key. Kind of like the "runner-up."
- **Example**: 
  - If "Roll Number" is the primary key, then "Email" becomes an alternate key.
- **Why it’s important**: They can still be used to find data.

---

### **6. Super Key**
- **What it does**: Any column (or combo of columns) that can uniquely identify a record. A primary key is always a super key, but not every super key is a primary key.
- **Example**: 
  - In a "Product" table, "Product ID" is a super key. Even "Product ID + Name" is a super key, but it’s unnecessary.
- **Why it’s important**: It shows you all possible ways to uniquely identify records.

---

### **7. Unique Key**
- **What it does**: Like a primary key, but it can have *one* null value. It ensures no duplicates except for the null.
- **Example**: 
  - In an "Employee" table, "Email" can be a unique key because each employee has one, but not all may have an email address.
- **Why it’s important**: It enforces uniqueness without being as strict as a primary key.

---

That’s it! Keys are just ways to organize and connect data in a database. Got a specific key you want me to explain more?

Here’s a **professional yet simple explanation** of all the keys commonly used in databases:

---

### **1. Primary Key**
- **Definition**: A column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each record in a table. It does not allow null values or duplicates.
- **Example**: 
  - In a "Student" table, "Roll Number" is the primary key because it uniquely identifies each student.
- **Purpose**: To ensure every record is unique and easily identifiable.

---

### **2. Foreign Key**
- **Definition**: A column or a set of columns in one table that establishes a relationship with the primary key in another table.
- **Example**: 
  - In an "Enrollment" table, "Student ID" is a foreign key linking to the "Student" table’s primary key.
- **Purpose**: To maintain referential integrity between two related tables.

---

### **3. Candidate Key**
- **Definition**: A column or a set of columns that can uniquely identify a record in a table. Among these, one is chosen as the primary key.
- **Example**: 
  - In a "Student" table, both "Roll Number" and "Email" could serve as unique identifiers. Both are candidate keys, but only one can be the primary key.
- **Purpose**: To provide options for defining the primary key.

---

### **4. Composite Key**
- **Definition**: A key that is formed by combining two or more columns to uniquely identify a record when a single column is not sufficient.
- **Example**: 
  - In an "Order" table, "Order ID" and "Product ID" together form a composite key to uniquely identify each item in the order.
- **Purpose**: To ensure uniqueness when no single column can serve as a key.

---

### **5. Alternate Key**
- **Definition**: A candidate key that was not chosen as the primary key. It serves as an alternative unique identifier for records.
- **Example**: 
  - If "Roll Number" is the primary key in a "Student" table, "Email" could be an alternate key.
- **Purpose**: To provide additional options for uniquely identifying records.

---

### **6. Super Key**
- **Definition**: A column or a combination of columns that can uniquely identify a record. It may contain additional columns beyond what is necessary for uniqueness.
- **Example**: 
  - In a "Product" table, "Product ID" is a super key. Even "Product ID + Product Name" is a super key, though it’s redundant.
- **Purpose**: To identify all possible unique combinations in a table.

---

### **7. Unique Key**
- **Definition**: A column or a set of columns that ensures all values in the column(s) are unique. Unlike a primary key, it allows one null value.
- **Example**: 
  - In an "Employee" table, "Email" can be a unique key since each employee has a unique email, but some might not have an email address (null).
- **Purpose**: To enforce uniqueness while allowing flexibility with null values.

This structured explanation balances simplicity with professionalism. Let me know if you want to explore a specific key in detail!


Certainly, Krushna! Let’s go into more detail while keeping the conversational style intact.

---

**Professor:**  
Alright, Krushna, have you heard of the **three-schema architecture in DBMS**?  

**Krushna:**  
Yes, a bit! It’s meant to separate the database into different levels to simplify management and hide complexity from users.  

**Professor:**  
Exactly. It ensures **abstraction** by dividing the database into three distinct layers. Let me break them down for you:  

1. **External Schema (View Level):**  
   - This level is **closest to the end-users**.  
   - It defines how **individual users or applications view the data**.  
   - For example, in a university database, students might see only their grades and personal details, while faculty can view class performance reports. Each user gets a customized view tailored to their needs.  
   - Think of it as different “windows” into the database, showing only what’s relevant.

2. **Conceptual Schema (Logical Level):**  
   - This is the **middle layer** and represents the **entire logical structure** of the database.  
   - It’s independent of how data is physically stored and focuses on **what data is stored** and the **relationships between them**.  
   - For example, it defines entities like *Students*, *Courses*, *Enrollment*, and their relationships but doesn’t concern itself with details like file paths or data blocks.  
   - This layer ensures consistency and integrity of data across all external views.

3. **Internal Schema (Physical Level):**  
   - This is the **lowest level** of the architecture and deals with the **physical storage of data**.  
   - It includes implementation details like **file organization, indexing, page layouts**, and **compression techniques**.  
   - For instance, it determines how a student’s data is actually stored on disk—whether in a heap file, a B-tree structure, or using hash indexing.

**Krushna:**  
Okay, so the external schema is for user-specific views, the conceptual schema represents the entire logical structure, and the internal schema handles the actual storage?  

**Professor:**  
Spot on! This **layered approach** offers many advantages:  
- **Data Independence:** Changes in one schema don’t affect others. For example, if storage techniques change (internal schema), the logical structure (conceptual schema) remains unaffected.  
- **Security:** The external schema ensures that users only see what they are allowed to access.  
- **Simplicity:** Users don’t need to worry about the complexity of physical data storage or even the entire database structure.  

**Krushna:**  
This makes sense! It keeps everything modular and easier to manage.  

**Professor:**  
Exactly, Krushna! The three-schema architecture is a cornerstone of database design. If you’d like, we can dive deeper into **data independence** or any other related concept next.  

**Krushna:**  
Sure, let’s do that next!

How’s this? Longer, but still easy to follow!

Entity-Relationship (ER) Model
Structure: Represents data using entities (objects) and relationships between them.
Example: An Employee entity connected to a Department entity through a Works-In relationship.
Advantage: Visual representation using ER diagrams makes it easy to understand database design.
Limitation: Mostly used in the design phase, not in implementation.


Sure! Here’s a straightforward explanation of **constraints** in DBMS:

---

**Constraints** are rules applied to database tables to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. They help maintain data integrity and enforce specific conditions on the data in the database. Here are the main types of constraints:

1. **NOT NULL Constraint**  
   - Ensures that a column cannot have NULL values.  
   - Example: A column for `EmployeeID` must always have a value.

2. **UNIQUE Constraint**  
   - Ensures all values in a column are unique, preventing duplicate entries.  
   - Example: A column for `Email` should have only unique email addresses.

3. **PRIMARY KEY Constraint**  
   - Combines **NOT NULL** and **UNIQUE** constraints.  
   - Ensures each row in a table can be uniquely identified.  
   - Example: `StudentID` in a student table.

4. **FOREIGN KEY Constraint**  
   - Enforces a relationship between two tables by linking one table’s column to another table’s **PRIMARY KEY**.  
   - Example: `OrderID` in an orders table references the `CustomerID` in a customers table.

5. **CHECK Constraint**  
   - Ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.  
   - Example: A column for `Age` must have values greater than 18.

6. **DEFAULT Constraint**  
   - Assigns a default value to a column if no value is provided during insertion.  
   - Example: Setting the default value of `Status` as "Active."

7. **INDEX Constraint**  
   - Improves database performance by creating an index on a column, speeding up data retrieval.  
   - Example: Indexing the `ProductID` column for faster search operations.

---

These constraints help enforce rules and ensure the database operates as intended.

### 1. **Entity** and **Types of Entities**

An **entity** is a real-world object or concept that can have data stored about it. Each entity is distinct and can be described by its attributes.

#### Types of Entities:

1. **Strong Entity**:
   - A **strong entity** is an entity that can exist independently and can be uniquely identified by its own attributes (primary key).
   - Example: 
     - `Student`: A student can be uniquely identified by a `StudentID`, and this entity doesn't rely on another entity for its identification.
     - Attributes: `StudentID`, `Name`, `DOB`
  
2. **Weak Entity**:
   - A **weak entity** cannot be uniquely identified by its own attributes and depends on a **strong entity** for identification. A weak entity has a **partial key** and requires a strong entity's key to form a **composite key**.
   - Example: 
     - `Course_Enrollment`: A weak entity that depends on the `Student` entity for identification. It cannot exist independently because a `Course_Enrollment` needs a `StudentID` and `CourseID` to be identified.
     - Attributes: `CourseID`, `Grade` (it needs `StudentID` as a reference to identify a specific student enrolled in a course).
     - In the ER diagram, weak entities are represented by **double rectangles**, and their relationship with strong entities is shown with **double diamonds**.

### 2. **Attribute** and **Types of Attributes**

An **attribute** is a property or characteristic of an entity. It describes the details about an entity.

#### Types of Attributes:

1. **Simple Attribute**:
   - A **simple attribute** is indivisible, meaning it cannot be broken down further.
   - Example: `StudentID`, `Name`

2. **Composite Attribute**:
   - A **composite attribute** can be broken down into smaller sub-parts.
   - Example: `Address` could be a composite attribute consisting of `Street`, `City`, and `ZIP Code`.

3. **Derived Attribute**:
   - A **derived attribute** is an attribute that can be derived from other attributes in the database.
   - Example: `Age` can be derived from `DOB` (Date of Birth).

4. **Multi-valued Attribute**:
   - A **multi-valued attribute** can have more than one value.
   - Example: `PhoneNumbers` where a student can have multiple phone numbers.

5. **Key Attribute**:
   - A **key attribute** is an attribute that uniquely identifies an entity instance.
   - Example: `StudentID` is a key attribute for the `Student` entity.

### 3. **Relationship** and **Types of Relationships**

A **relationship** in an ER model defines how two or more entities are connected.

#### Types of Relationships:

1. **One-to-One (1:1)**:
   - In a **one-to-one** relationship, one instance of an entity is related to one instance of another entity.
   - Example: A `Person` has one `Passport`.
     - A `Person` entity is related to a `Passport` entity where each person can have only one passport.

2. **One-to-Many (1:N)**:
   - In a **one-to-many** relationship, one instance of an entity is related to many instances of another entity.
   - Example: A `Department` has many `Employees`.
     - A `Department` entity can have multiple `Employee` entities, but each `Employee` works in only one `Department`.

3. **Many-to-Many (M:N)**:
   - In a **many-to-many** relationship, many instances of one entity are related to many instances of another entity.
   - Example: A `Student` can enroll in many `Courses`, and a `Course` can have many `Students`.
     - To handle this, an intermediate entity (like `Enrollment`) is created to break down the many-to-many relationship.

4. **Recursive (Unary) Relationship**:
   - A **recursive** or **unary** relationship is when an entity has a relationship with itself.
   - Example: An `Employee` can be a `Manager` of other `Employees`.
     - The `Employee` entity has a recursive relationship, as one employee can manage multiple other employees.

### 4. **ER Diagram Example**

Let's consider a **University Database** as an example to illustrate entities, attributes, and relationships.

Entities:
- `Student`: Represents students at the university.
- `Course`: Represents courses offered by the university.
- `Instructor`: Represents instructors who teach courses.

Attributes:
- `Student`: `StudentID` (Primary Key), `Name`, `DOB`
- `Course`: `CourseID` (Primary Key), `CourseName`
- `Instructor`: `InstructorID` (Primary Key), `Name`, `Department`

Relationships:
1. **Enrolls (1:N)**: A `Student` can enroll in many `Courses`.
2. **Teaches (1:N)**: An `Instructor` teaches many `Courses`.

In the ER diagram:
- **Entities** are represented as rectangles.
- **Attributes** are represented as ovals connected to the entities.
- **Relationships** are represented as diamonds, with lines connecting entities to relationships.

### ER Diagram Example:

```
+-----------+        +------------+        +-----------+
|  Student  |        |   Course   |        | Instructor |
+-----------+        +------------+        +-----------+
| StudentID |        | CourseID   |        |InstructorID|
| Name      |        | CourseName |        | Name      |
| DOB       |        +------------+        | Department|
+-----------+                               +-----------+
     |                                         |
   Enrolls                                   Teaches
     |                                         |
+----------------------------+        +----------------------------+
|       Enrollment            |        |       Course_Instructor    |
+----------------------------+        +----------------------------+
```

### 5. **Participation Constraints**

**Participation constraints** describe whether an entity must participate in a relationship or not. There are two main types:

1. **Total Participation**:
   - Every instance of the entity must be involved in the relationship.
   - Example: Every `Student` must enroll in at least one `Course`. This is **total participation** for the `Student` entity.

2. **Partial Participation**:
   - Some instances of the entity may not be involved in the relationship.
   - Example: Not all `Instructor` entities may teach a `Course` every semester. This is **partial participation** for the `Instructor` entity.
