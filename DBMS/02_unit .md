### **Data Models in Database Design**

A **data model** defines how data is structured, stored, and manipulated in a database. It provides a framework for organizing and understanding data.

---

#### **Types of Data Models**  
Here are the most commonly used types:

1. **Hierarchical Data Model**  
   - **Structure:** Data is organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships.  
   - **Key Concept:** Each child has only one parent, but a parent can have multiple children.  
   - **Example:** An organization’s structure where the CEO (parent) manages departments (children).  

   ```
   CEO
   ├── HR
   ├── Finance
   └── IT
   ```

   - **Use Case:** File systems (e.g., XML documents).

---

2. **Network Data Model**  
   - **Structure:** Data is organized as a graph with many-to-many relationships.  
   - **Key Concept:** An entity (node) can have multiple parents and children.  
   - **Example:** A university database with courses and students.  
     - A student can enroll in multiple courses.  
     - A course can have multiple students.  

   - **Use Case:** Complex relationships like transport systems or telecommunication networks.

---

3. **Relational Data Model** (**Most Important**)  
   - **Structure:** Data is represented in **tables (relations)** with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).  
   - **Key Concept:** Relationships between tables are established using **keys** (Primary Key, Foreign Key).  
   - **Example:**  
     **Student Table**  
     | StudentID | Name   | Age  |  
     |-----------|--------|------|  
     | 101       | Alice  | 20   |  
     | 102       | Bob    | 22   |  

     **Course Table**  
     | CourseID | CourseName |  
     |----------|------------|  
     | CS101    | Databases  |  
     | CS102    | Networks   |  

     - Relationship: **StudentID** in `Student` links to `Enrollments` table, showing which students enrolled in which courses.

   - **Use Case:** Widely used in modern databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

---

4. **Entity-Relationship (ER) Data Model**  
   - **Structure:** Data is represented using **entities**, their **attributes**, and **relationships**.  
   - **Key Concept:** Focuses on conceptual design, creating ER diagrams for visualizing data.  
   - **Example:** Representing a library system:  
     - Entities: Books, Members.  
     - Relationships: Borrowing books.  

   - **Use Case:** Conceptual database design before implementing the relational model.

---

5. **Object-Oriented Data Model**  
   - **Structure:** Data is represented as objects, similar to programming languages like Java or Python.  
   - **Key Concept:** Includes attributes (properties) and methods (functions).  
   - **Example:**  
     - Object: **Student**  
       - Attributes: `Name`, `Age`.  
       - Methods: `Enroll()`.  

   - **Use Case:** Applications requiring both data and functionality, like multimedia databases.

---

#### **Importance of Data Models**  
- **Data Organization:** Structures data for easy access and storage.  
- **Communication:** Acts as a blueprint for communication between stakeholders (e.g., developers and business analysts).  
- **Database Integrity:** Ensures data consistency and correctness using constraints.  
- **Flexibility:** Adapts to different use cases, like hierarchical for file systems or relational for business data.  
- **Foundation for Design:** Provides the basis for creating efficient and scalable databases.

### **E-R Model Basics**

The **Entity-Relationship (E-R) Model** is a high-level conceptual data model used to describe the structure of a database in terms of entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.

---

#### **1. Entities**  
An **entity** represents a real-world object or concept with distinct identity, typically corresponding to a table in the relational model.  
- **Examples:**  
  - **Student**  
  - **Course**  
  - **Employee**  
  - **Product**  

Entities can be categorized as:
- **Strong Entities:** Entities that exist independently. They have a primary key.
  - Example: **Student** (with `StudentID` as the primary key).
  
- **Weak Entities:** Entities that cannot exist independently and depend on a strong entity. They rely on a **partial key** and must always be associated with a strong entity.
  - Example: **Dependent** (dependent on an **Employee** entity).

---

#### **2. Attributes**  
Attributes are the properties or characteristics of an entity. They provide more information about the entity.  
- **Examples:**  
  - **Student:** `StudentID`, `Name`, `Age`  
  - **Course:** `CourseID`, `CourseName`  

Types of Attributes:
- **Simple (Atomic) Attributes:** Indivisible values.  
  - Example: `Age`, `CourseID`.
  
- **Composite Attributes:** Can be subdivided into smaller sub-parts.  
  - Example: **Full Name** (can be split into `FirstName` and `LastName`).
  
- **Derived Attributes:** Can be calculated from other attributes.  
  - Example: **Age** (derived from `DateOfBirth`).
  
- **Multi-Valued Attributes:** Can have multiple values for an entity.  
  - Example: **Phone Numbers** (a person can have multiple phone numbers).

---

#### **3. Entity Sets**  
An **entity set** is a collection of similar entities. For example, all students in a university form an entity set of **Students**.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Student Set** (includes all students in a university).  
  - **Course Set** (includes all courses offered by the university).  

---

#### **4. Relationships**  
A **relationship** represents an association between two or more entities.  
- **Example:**  
  - A **Student** **enrolls** in a **Course**.  
  - **Employee** **works for** a **Department**.  

Types of Relationships:
- **Unary (Recursive) Relationships:** Relationship between instances of the same entity.  
  - Example: An employee **manages** other employees.
  
- **Binary Relationships:** Involves two entities.  
  - Example: A **Student** **enrolls** in a **Course**.
  
- **Ternary Relationships:** Involves three entities.  
  - Example: A **Supplier** supplies a **Product** to a **Store**.

---

#### **5. Relationship Sets**  
A **relationship set** is a collection of similar relationships. For instance, all students who enroll in courses form an **enrollment** relationship set.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Enrollment Set** (students enrolled in various courses).

---

#### **6. Mapping Cardinalities**  
Cardinality defines the number of occurrences of one entity that can be associated with another entity in a relationship.  
- **One-to-One (1:1):** Each instance of one entity is associated with at most one instance of another entity.  
  - Example: A **Person** has one **Passport**.

- **One-to-Many (1:N):** One instance of an entity is associated with many instances of another entity.  
  - Example: A **Department** has many **Employees**.

- **Many-to-Many (M:N):** Many instances of one entity are associated with many instances of another entity.  
  - Example: A **Student** can enroll in many **Courses**, and a **Course** can have many **Students**.

---

#### **7. Keys**  
- **Primary Key (PK):** A set of attributes that uniquely identify an entity in an entity set.  
  - Example: `StudentID` in **Student** entity.

- **Candidate Key:** A set of attributes that can uniquely identify an entity, but there may be more than one in a given entity set.  
  - Example: Both `StudentID` and `Email` can uniquely identify a student, so both are candidate keys.

- **Foreign Key (FK):** An attribute (or set of attributes) in one entity that refers to the primary key of another entity, establishing a link between the two.  
  - Example: `StudentID` in **Enrollment** table, which refers to the `StudentID` in **Student** table.

---

#### **8. Features of the E-R Model**
- **Simplicity:** Easy to understand with a visual representation.  
- **Conceptual Clarity:** Helps separate the data from relationships and offers a clear structure.  
- **Flexibility:** Allows designers to create abstract and precise representations of real-world situations.  
- **Modularity:** Easily allows modifications or extensions.

### **Integrity Constraints in a Database**

Integrity constraints are rules that ensure the accuracy and consistency of data in a relational database. They enforce logical rules to maintain data integrity and prevent invalid data from being stored in the database.

Here are the major types of integrity constraints:

---

### **1. Domain Integrity**
- **Definition**: Ensures that data in a column adheres to the defined data type, format, and range of values.
- **Purpose**: Prevents invalid data from being entered into a column.
- **Examples**:
  - Data types (`INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`, etc.).
  - Constraints like `NOT NULL`, `DEFAULT`, and `CHECK`.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT NOT NULL,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Age INT CHECK (Age >= 18)
);
```
- `NOT NULL`: Ensures the column cannot have NULL values.
- `CHECK`: Ensures the `Age` is 18 or above.

---

### **2. Entity Integrity**
- **Definition**: Ensures that each row in a table is uniquely identifiable.
- **Purpose**: Prevents duplicate rows and ensures no `NULL` values in primary key columns.
- **Enforced by**: The **Primary Key** constraint.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100)
);
```
- The `PRIMARY KEY` ensures each `EmployeeID` is unique and non-NULL.

---

### **3. Referential Integrity**
- **Definition**: Ensures that a foreign key value in a referencing table matches a primary key value in the referenced table, or is `NULL`.
- **Purpose**: Maintains the relationships between tables and prevents orphaned rows.
- **Enforced by**: The **Foreign Key** constraint, with options like `ON DELETE CASCADE` or `ON UPDATE SET NULL`.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
- If a customer is deleted, all their orders will also be deleted.

---

### **4. Unique Integrity**
- **Definition**: Ensures that all the values in a column (or combination of columns) are unique across rows.
- **Purpose**: Prevents duplicate values in columns that are not primary keys.
- **Enforced by**: The **Unique** constraint.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```
- `Email` must be unique across all rows.

---

### **5. Key Integrity**
- **Definition**: Ensures that a primary key or unique key uniquely identifies a row.
- **Purpose**: Avoids duplicate rows and ensures efficient querying.
- **Enforced by**: Primary keys, unique keys, and candidate keys.

---

### **6. Check Constraint**
- **Definition**: Ensures that column values satisfy a specific logical condition.
- **Purpose**: Enforces additional business rules at the column level.
- **Examples**:
  - Restricting a column's range of values.
  - Ensuring data adheres to a specific pattern.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (Price > 0),
    Stock INT CHECK (Stock >= 0)
);
```
- Ensures that `Price` is positive and `Stock` is non-negative.

---

### **7. Default Constraint**
- **Definition**: Assigns a default value to a column if no value is provided.
- **Purpose**: Simplifies data entry by automatically filling a column with a predefined value.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Accounts (
    AccountID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    AccountStatus VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Active'
);
```
- If no value is provided for `AccountStatus`, it will default to `'Active'`.

---

### **8. NULL and NOT NULL Constraints**
- **Definition**:
  - `NULL`: Allows a column to store `NULL` values.
  - `NOT NULL`: Ensures a column cannot have `NULL` values.
- **Purpose**: Ensures mandatory fields are always filled.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Department VARCHAR(50) NULL
);
```
- `Name` must always have a value, but `Department` can be `NULL`.
