### **Introduction to Transaction Management**

Transaction management ensures the integrity and consistency of the database, especially when multiple users are accessing and modifying the data concurrently. A **transaction** is a logical unit of work that contains a sequence of operations, such as reading or writing data.

---

### **ACID Properties** (Ensuring Reliable Transactions)

ACID stands for four key properties that a transaction must guarantee:

1. **Atomicity**:
   - A transaction is treated as a single unit, which either **completes entirely** or **does not happen at all**.
   - Example: If a transaction involves transferring money from one account to another, the system ensures that both the **debit** and **credit** happen, or neither does, even if the system crashes in between.

2. **Consistency**:
   - A transaction must take the database from one **consistent state** to another.
   - Example: If a database constraint is violated (like trying to add a student with an existing ID), the transaction will not complete.

3. **Isolation**:
   - Transactions must be **executed independently** of one another, even if they run concurrently.
   - Example: Two transactions happening at the same time should not interfere with each other, and the outcome should be as if they ran serially.

4. **Durability**:
   - Once a transaction is **committed**, its changes are permanent, even if there is a system failure.
   - Example: After transferring funds and committing the transaction, the updated balance will remain even after a crash.

### **Transactions and Schedules**

A **schedule** is an interleaving of operations from multiple transactions. A **serial schedule** occurs when transactions are executed one after the other, without overlapping, while a **concurrent schedule** has transactions executing simultaneously.

#### **Serial vs. Non-Serial Schedules**
- **Serial Schedule**: No interleaving of operations. It is always **safe** and **isolated**.
- **Non-Serial Schedule**: Operations from different transactions interleave, and special care must be taken to avoid conflicts.

**Conflict Serializable Schedule**: A schedule that can be rearranged into a serial schedule by swapping non-conflicting operations.

---

### **Concurrent Execution of Transactions**

When transactions run concurrently, **conflicts** can occur. These conflicts must be managed to maintain **serializability** (i.e., ensuring the final outcome is the same as if the transactions were executed one after another).

#### Common Problems in Concurrent Execution:
1. **Lost Updates**:
   - Two transactions update the same data, and one update is lost.
   - Example: Transaction 1 reads a value, then Transaction 2 modifies it. When Transaction 1 writes its updated value, it overwrites the change made by Transaction 2.

2. **Temporary Inconsistent State (Uncommitted Data)**:
   - A transaction reads data that is yet to be committed.
   - Example: Transaction 1 updates a balance, but Transaction 2 reads the uncommitted data before Transaction 1 commits.

3. **Inconsistent Retrieval (Non-repeatable Reads)**:
   - A transaction reads the same data multiple times, and it changes between reads due to other transactions.
   - Example: Transaction 1 reads a value, then Transaction 2 modifies it before Transaction 1 reads it again.

---

### **Transaction Scheduling and Control**

To manage concurrency and avoid conflicts, databases use **locking mechanisms** like:
- **Two-Phase Locking (2PL)**: Ensures that once a transaction releases a lock, it cannot acquire more locks, preventing certain types of conflicts.
- **Timestamp Ordering**: Transactions are ordered based on timestamps to avoid conflicts.
- **Optimistic Concurrency Control**: Transactions are allowed to execute without locking resources, and conflicts are resolved before commit.

---

### Summary of Key Concepts

- **ACID Properties**: Ensure that transactions are reliable and consistent.
- **Transaction Schedules**: Can be serial or concurrent, with serial schedules being simpler to manage.
- **Concurrency**: Care must be taken to avoid conflicts such as lost updates or inconsistent reads when transactions execute concurrently.

### **What is Serializability?**  
Serializability means making sure that when multiple transactions are running at the same time, the final result is the same as if those transactions ran one by one (in a sequence). It ensures there are no conflicts or errors caused by transactions overlapping.

---

### **Why is Serializability Important?**  
When many users or systems are working with the database at the same time, their transactions might interfere with each other. Serializability prevents problems like:  
- Incorrect data updates  
- Lost changes  
- Reading incomplete data  

---

### **Example to Understand Serializability:**  
Imagine two people (A and B) are shopping online and using the same wallet balance: ₹1,000.  

1. **Transaction 1 (A):** A wants to buy a phone for ₹800.  
2. **Transaction 2 (B):** B wants to buy a watch for ₹500.  

#### Without Serializability (Conflicts Happen):  
- Both A and B check the balance at the same time: ₹1,000.  
- A deducts ₹800, leaving ₹200, but B doesn't know the balance has changed and also deducts ₹500.  
- Final balance = ₹200 (from A) and ₹500 deducted by B → **Incorrect result!**  

#### With Serializability:  
- The database ensures one transaction finishes before the other starts.  
- A buys the phone (₹1,000 - ₹800 = ₹200).  
- Then, B tries to buy the watch but sees the balance is ₹200 and cannot proceed.  
- **Final balance is correct.**  

---

### **Key Point:**  
Serializability ensures that even though transactions may run together, the result will always be as if they ran one after the other, avoiding conflicts or errors.

### Types of SQL Languages

SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with databases. It is divided into several types, each serving a distinct purpose. Here’s a short note on each type of SQL language, with examples:

---

### 1. **Data Definition Language (DDL)**
DDL is used to define and modify database structures such as tables, schemas, and indexes.

- **Common Commands**:
  - `CREATE`: Creates new tables or databases.
  - `ALTER`: Modifies existing database objects.
  - `DROP`: Deletes tables, databases, or other database objects.
  - `TRUNCATE`: Removes all rows from a table but keeps the structure.

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE students (
      id INT,
      name VARCHAR(50),
      age INT
  );
  ```

---

### 2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**
DML is used to manipulate data within database tables. This includes inserting, updating, deleting, and selecting data.

- **Common Commands**:
  - `INSERT`: Adds new records to a table.
  - `UPDATE`: Modifies existing records.
  - `DELETE`: Removes records from a table.
  - `SELECT`: Retrieves data from one or more tables.

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO students (id, name, age)
  VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 20);
  
  SELECT * FROM students;
  ```

---

### 3. **Data Query Language (DQL)**
DQL is used to query or retrieve data from the database. It primarily consists of the `SELECT` command.

- **Common Command**:
  - `SELECT`: Retrieves data from a database.
  
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name, age FROM students WHERE age > 18;
  ```

---

### 4. **Data Control Language (DCL)**
DCL is used to control access and permissions in the database. It deals with granting or revoking privileges.

- **Common Commands**:
  - `GRANT`: Assigns specific privileges to users.
  - `REVOKE`: Removes specific privileges from users.

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  GRANT SELECT ON students TO user1;
  REVOKE SELECT ON students FROM user1;
  ```

---

### 5. **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**
TCL is used to manage transactions within the database, ensuring that changes are committed or rolled back.

- **Common Commands**:
  - `COMMIT`: Saves the changes made in the transaction.
  - `ROLLBACK`: Undoes the changes made in the transaction.
  - `SAVEPOINT`: Sets a point in a transaction to which you can later roll back.
  - `SET TRANSACTION`: Sets the properties of a transaction.

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  BEGIN;
  UPDATE students SET age = 21 WHERE id = 1;
  COMMIT;
  ```

---

### Summary Table:

| SQL Type               | Purpose                                          | Common Commands                                | Example |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------|
| **DDL**                | Defines database structures                     | `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`         | `CREATE TABLE students (...)` |

Aggregate Functions:
These are functions in SQL that operate on a set of rows (or values) and return a single result. They perform calculations or operations on multiple rows to return a summary value.
Common aggregate functions include:
COUNT(): Returns the number of rows that match a specified condition.
SUM(): Returns the total sum of a numeric column.
AVG(): Returns the average value of a numeric column.
MIN(): Returns the minimum value from a set of rows.
MAX(): Returns the maximum value from a set of rows.

Got it! Here's a simple representation of the `students` table in a tabular format with some sample data, which you can use to apply the aggregate functions:

### **students** Table

| id  | name        | age | grade |
|-----|-------------|-----|-------|
| 1   | John Doe    | 20  | 85    |
| 2   | Jane Smith  | 22  | 90    |
| 3   | Sam Brown   | 21  | 75    |
| 4   | Alice Green | 23  | 92    |
| 5   | Bob White   | 20  | 88    |

### Now, let's apply the aggregate functions:

1. **COUNT()** – Count the number of rows in the table:
   - Example: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;`
   - **Result**: 5 (There are 5 students)

2. **SUM()** – Sum the `grade` column:
   - Example: `SELECT SUM(grade) FROM students;`
   - **Result**: 430 (85 + 90 + 75 + 92 + 88)

3. **AVG()** – Find the average grade:
   - Example: `SELECT AVG(grade) FROM students;`
   - **Result**: 86 (430 / 5)

4. **MIN()** – Find the minimum grade:
   - Example: `SELECT MIN(grade) FROM students;`
   - **Result**: 75 (The lowest grade is 75, from Sam Brown)

5. **MAX()** – Find the maximum grade:
   - Example: `SELECT MAX(grade) FROM students;`
   - **Result**: 92 (The highest grade is 92, from Alice Green)

This table structure allows you to easily visualize how the aggregate functions operate on the data.

Here’s how you can write queries in **Relational Algebra** using the **Selection (σ)** and **Projection (π)** operators. I’ll explain both operators and provide examples.

---

### **Operators Overview**:
1. **Selection (σ)**:
   - Used to retrieve rows (tuples) that satisfy a given condition.
   - Syntax:  
     **σ<condition>(Relation)**  
     Example: `σMarks > 50(Student)` retrieves all students with marks greater than 50.

2. **Projection (π)**:
   - Used to retrieve specific columns (attributes) from a table.
   - Syntax:  
     **π<attribute_list>(Relation)**  
     Example: `πRoll_No, Name(Student)` retrieves only the `Roll_No` and `Name` columns from the `Student` table.

---

### **Example Queries Using Selection and Projection**:

#### Example 1: Retrieve students who scored more than 75 marks.
```plaintext
σMarks > 75(Student)
```
- Retrieves all rows from the `Student` table where `Marks` > 75.

#### Example 2: Retrieve only the `Roll_No` and `Name` of students who scored more than 75 marks.
```plaintext
πRoll_No, Name(σMarks > 75(Student))
```
- First, **select** rows where `Marks > 75`, then **project** only the `Roll_No` and `Name` columns.

#### Example 3: Retrieve all unique subjects taught by teachers.
```plaintext
πSubject(Teacher)
```
- Projects only the `Subject` column from the `Teacher` table.

#### Example 4: Retrieve names of students enrolled in "Mathematics".
```plaintext
πName(σSubject = 'Mathematics'(Student_Subject))
```
- Selects rows where the `Subject` is "Mathematics" from the `Student_Subject` table, then projects only the `Name` column.

---

### How to Combine Selection and Projection:

You can chain multiple **selection** and **projection** operations to build more complex queries. For instance:

#### Example 5: Retrieve the names and marks of students who scored more than 90 in "Science".
```plaintext
πName, Marks(σMarks > 90 ∧ Subject = 'Science'(Student_Subject))
```
- First, apply a **selection** condition for `Marks > 90` and `Subject = 'Science'`.
- Then, **project** the `Name` and `Marks` columns.

---

### Notes:
- **σ** (Selection) filters rows based on conditions.
- **π** (Projection) filters columns (attributes) to show specific ones.
- You can combine them to refine the query further.
- Parentheses are used to define the order of operations.
