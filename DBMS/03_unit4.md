### **What is Serializability?**  
Serializability means making sure that when multiple transactions are running at the same time, the final result is the same as if those transactions ran one by one (in a sequence). It ensures there are no conflicts or errors caused by transactions overlapping.

### **Why is Serializability Important?**  
When many users or systems are working with the database at the same time, their transactions might interfere with each other. Serializability prevents problems like:  
- Incorrect data updates  
- Lost changes  
- Reading incomplete data

### **Example to Understand Serializability:**  
Imagine two people (A and B) are shopping online and using the same wallet balance: ₹1,000.  

1. **Transaction 1 (A):** A wants to buy a phone for ₹800.  
2. **Transaction 2 (B):** B wants to buy a watch for ₹500.  

#### Without Serializability (Conflicts Happen):  
- Both A and B check the balance at the same time: ₹1,000.  
- A deducts ₹800, leaving ₹200, but B doesn't know the balance has changed and also deducts ₹500.  
- Final balance = ₹200 (from A) and ₹500 deducted by B → **Incorrect result!**  

#### With Serializability:  
- The database ensures one transaction finishes before the other starts.  
- A buys the phone (₹1,000 - ₹800 = ₹200).  
- Then, B tries to buy the watch but sees the balance is ₹200 and cannot proceed.  
- **Final balance is correct.**

### **Key Point:**  
Serializability ensures that even though transactions may run together, the result will always be as if they ran one after the other, avoiding conflicts or errors.
