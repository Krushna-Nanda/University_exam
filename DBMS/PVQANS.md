### **Q5) Lock in DBMS**

#### **What is a Lock?**
- **Definition**: A lock is used to manage how multiple transactions access data to maintain consistency and prevent conflicts.
- **Types of Locks**:
  - **Shared Lock (S)**: Allows multiple transactions to read the data at the same time.
  - **Exclusive Lock (X)**: Only one transaction can modify the data, and others cannot access it.

---

### **Two-Phase Locking (2PL) Protocol**

#### **Definition**:
- A protocol that ensures **conflict serializability** by dividing a transaction's locking process into two phases:
  1. **Growing Phase**: 
     - Locks can be **acquired** but cannot be released.
  2. **Shrinking Phase**: 
     - Locks are **released**, but no new locks can be acquired.

---

### **Variations of 2PL Protocol**

#### 1. **Basic 2PL**:
   - Locks follow the two phases (growing and shrinking).
   - **Issue**: May cause cascading rollbacks (one failure affects others).

#### 2. **Strict 2PL**:
   - Exclusive locks are held until the transaction **commits or aborts**.
   - **Advantage**: Prevents cascading rollbacks.

#### 3. **Rigorous 2PL**:
   - Both shared and exclusive locks are held until the transaction **commits or aborts**.
   - **Advantage**: Provides stronger safety compared to Strict 2PL.

#### 4. **Conservative 2PL (Static 2PL)**:
   - All locks are acquired **before** the transaction starts.
   - **Advantage**: Prevents deadlocks completely.

### **Comparison of Variations**

| **Variation**         | **Cascadelessness** | **Recoverability** | **Deadlock**     | **Conflict Serializability** |
|------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| **Basic 2PL**          | No                  | Yes                | Possible         | Yes                          |
| **Strict 2PL**         | Yes                 | Yes                | Possible         | Yes                          |
| **Rigorous 2PL**       | Yes                 | Yes                | Possible         | Yes                          |
| **Conservative 2PL**   | Yes                 | Yes                | No               | Yes                          |

### **Key Terms in Variations**

1. **Cascadelessness**:
   -Definition: A schedule is cascadeless if a transaction can read only committed data.
   - Strict and Rigorous 2PL provide cascadelessness.

2. **Recoverability**:
   - Ensures transactions commit only if dependent transactions also commit.
   - All 2PL variations ensure recoverability.
     
3. **Deadlock**:
   - Definition: Deadlock occurs when transactions wait indefinitely for each other's locks.
   - Conservative 2PL avoids deadlocks by acquiring all locks at once.while others may experience deadlocks.

4. **Conflict Serializability**:
   - Definition: A schedule is conflict-serializable if it can be transformed into a serial schedule by swapping non-conflicting operations.
   - All 2PL variations ensure conflict serializability.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **2PL Protocol** helps ensure proper synchronization in concurrent transactions.
- Variations like Strict and Rigorous 2PL improve reliability, while Conservative 2PL eliminates deadlocks.

  ### **Q6) Short Notes on Two Topics**

---

### **i. Cursor vs. Trigger**

#### **Cursor**:
- **Definition**: A database object that allows traversal over rows in a result set, row by row.
- **Usage**:
  - Used to **process individual rows** of a query.
  - Can fetch data **one row at a time**.
- **Types**:
  - **Implicit Cursor**: Automatically managed by DBMS for single-row queries.
  - **Explicit Cursor**: Manually controlled for multi-row queries.
- **Example**: Looping through rows to update or process each row.
  
#### **Trigger**:
- **Definition**: A set of SQL statements that automatically execute in response to certain events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on a table.
- **Usage**:
  - Automatically triggered by changes in the database.
  - Used for **data validation**, **audit logging**, or **enforcing business rules**.
- **Example**: Automatically updating a "last_modified" column when data changes.

---

### **ii. Query Optimization**

#### **Definition**: The process of improving query performance by minimizing resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O).
  
#### **Techniques**:
- **Using Indexes**: Speed up searches by reducing the number of rows to scan.
- **Query Refactoring**: Rewriting the query for better efficiency (e.g., using joins instead of subqueries).
- **Join Ordering**: Rearranging the order of joins to minimize computation.
- **Using Efficient Aggregations**: Avoiding unnecessary groupings or calculations.

#### **Goal**: Achieve faster query execution and reduced resource usage.

---

### **iii. Data Warehouse**

#### **Definition**: A centralized repository for storing large volumes of historical data from various sources for analysis and reporting.

#### **Features**:
- **Data Integration**: Combines data from multiple sources.
- **Time-Variant**: Stores data over long periods for trend analysis.
- **Subject-Oriented**: Focuses on key business areas (e.g., sales, finance).
  
#### **Purpose**: Supports **decision-making** through data analysis and business intelligence tools.

---

### **iv. Log-based Database Recovery**

#### **Definition**: A method of recovering a database to a consistent state after a failure by using a **transaction log**.

#### **How it Works**:
- **Transaction Log**: A record of all database changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- **Recovery Process**:
  - **Undo**: Rollback uncommitted transactions.
  - **Redo**: Apply committed transactions that were not yet written to disk.
  
#### **Goal**: Ensure database consistency and durability after a crash.
