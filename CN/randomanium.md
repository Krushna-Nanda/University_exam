Got it! Let me explain in more detail. The **congestion avoidance phase** increases the window size in a controlled, linear way after the threshold is reached, rather than exponentially. Here's how it works step-by-step:

---

### **Congestion Avoidance in Detail**

1. **What is the window size?**
   - The **window size** is the number of packets a sender can send before waiting for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver. It controls how much data is sent at a time.

2. **What is the threshold?**
   - The **threshold** is a value that helps avoid congestion in the network. It marks the point where the sender switches from sending packets quickly (exponential growth) to sending packets more slowly (linear growth).

3. **How does the window grow?**
   - **Before the threshold**: The window grows **exponentially**, meaning it doubles with each round-trip (ACK received). This is called **slow start**.
   - **After the threshold**: The window grows **linearly**, meaning it increases by **one packet per round-trip** (for all ACKs in one round-trip time).

---

### **Why Linear Growth?**
If the window keeps growing too fast (like doubling all the time), the network might get overloaded and start dropping packets. So, after reaching the threshold, we **slow down** and add one packet at a time to avoid overwhelming the network.

---

### **Example**

Let’s say:
- The **threshold** = 8 packets.
- The **window size** starts at 1 packet.

#### **Before the Threshold (Exponential Growth - Slow Start):**
- Round 1: Send **1 packet**, get ACK → Window size = **2**.
- Round 2: Send **2 packets**, get ACKs → Window size = **4**.
- Round 3: Send **4 packets**, get ACKs → Window size = **8**.
- Now, the window size = **threshold** (8). We switch to **linear growth**.

#### **After the Threshold (Linear Growth - Congestion Avoidance):**
- Round 4: Send **8 packets**, get ACKs → Window size = **9** (increased by 1).
- Round 5: Send **9 packets**, get ACKs → Window size = **10** (increased by 1).
- Round 6: Send **10 packets**, get ACKs → Window size = **11**, and so on.

---

### **How Does It Work in Practice?**
1. Every **round-trip time (RTT)** (time it takes to send packets and get ACKs), the sender increases the window size by **1 packet**.
2. Over time, the window grows slowly but steadily, ensuring that the network remains stable and doesn’t get congested.

---

### **Conclusion**
In congestion avoidance:
- Before the threshold: Window grows **fast** (exponentially).
- After the threshold: Window grows **slowly** (linearly, one packet at a time per RTT).

This way, the sender avoids sending too much data too quickly, preventing packet loss and keeping the network running smoothly!


### **Fast Retransmit Explanation**
In TCP, the **Fast Retransmit** mechanism is used to detect and recover from packet loss **quickly**, without waiting for a timeout. It works by relying on **duplicate acknowledgments (ACKs)** sent by the receiver when it receives out-of-order packets.

---

### **Key Idea**
- If the sender receives **three duplicate ACKs**, it assumes that a packet has been lost and retransmits it **immediately**, instead of waiting for a timeout (which takes longer).

---

### **Example**
Let’s walk through an example step-by-step:

#### **Setup:**
- The sender wants to send 5 packets: **P1, P2, P3, P4, P5**.
- The receiver acknowledges packets in order.

#### **Normal Case (No Packet Loss):**
1. Sender sends **P1, P2, P3, P4, P5**.
2. Receiver sends ACKs for each packet in order: **ACK1, ACK2, ACK3, ACK4, ACK5**.
3. Everything works perfectly.

---

#### **With Packet Loss (Fast Retransmit Scenario):**
1. **Sender sends:** P1, P2, P3, P4, P5.
2. **Packet P2 is lost** in the network.
3. Receiver receives **P1**, but then **P3, P4, P5** arrive **out of order** because **P2 is missing**.
4. Receiver sends **duplicate ACKs** for **P1** because it is still waiting for P2:
   - **ACK1** (normal acknowledgment for P1).
   - **Duplicate ACK1** (after receiving P3, because P2 is missing).
   - **Duplicate ACK1** (after receiving P4, still waiting for P2).
   - **Duplicate ACK1** (after receiving P5, still waiting for P2).

5. **Sender receives 3 duplicate ACKs (ACK1) for P2**:
   - Sender assumes **P2 is lost** (based on the rule of 3 duplicate ACKs).
   - Sender immediately retransmits **P2** without waiting for a timeout.

6. **Receiver receives the retransmitted P2**:
   - Now, the receiver sends **ACK5** (indicating it has received all packets in order up to P5).

---

### **Why Fast Retransmit is Useful**
- **Without Fast Retransmit:** The sender would wait for a **timeout** to detect packet loss, which could take a long time and delay the flow of data.
- **With Fast Retransmit:** The sender quickly detects packet loss after 3 duplicate ACKs and retransmits the lost packet, reducing delays.

---

### **Summary**
1. **Duplicate ACKs** are a signal of packet loss.
2. **Three duplicate ACKs** trigger **Fast Retransmit**, which resends the lost packet immediately.
3. This reduces waiting time compared to relying solely on timeouts.


# handshake


Certainly! Here's a professional explanation of the **Three-Way Handshake**:

---

### **Three-Way Handshake - Professional Explanation:**

1. **Step 1: SYN (Synchronization)**
   - The sender initiates the connection by sending a **SYN** (synchronize) packet to the receiver. This indicates the sender’s desire to establish a connection and begins the handshake process.

2. **Step 2: SYN-ACK (Acknowledgment)**
   - The receiver responds with a **SYN-ACK** (synchronize-acknowledge) packet. This serves two purposes:
     - It acknowledges the sender's **SYN** packet by incrementing the sequence number.
     - It also sends its own **SYN** to signal readiness for connection.

3. **Step 3: ACK (Acknowledgment)**
   - The sender acknowledges the receiver's **SYN-ACK** packet by sending an **ACK** (acknowledge) packet. This final step completes the handshake and establishes the connection between the sender and receiver, allowing data transfer to begin.

---

### **Summary:**
- The Three-Way Handshake ensures that both parties agree to and are ready for communication before data transfer begins. This process helps establish a reliable connection and synchronization between the sender and receiver.

Here are **examples** to explain the working of the **Go-Back-N Protocol** and **Selective Repeat Protocol**, structured like the one you provided:

---

### **Go-Back-N Protocol Example**  
**Key Features**:
- Sender can send multiple packets (up to the window size) without waiting for an acknowledgment (ACK) for each one.
- If an error or loss occurs, the sender **retransmits all packets starting from the one that was lost or corrupted**.

#### Example:
Let’s say:
- **Window size = 4 packets**.
- Sender sends packets: P1, P2, P3, P4.
- Receiver sends acknowledgments (ACKs) back for correctly received packets.

**Scenario**:
1. **Round 1**:
   - Sender sends **P1, P2, P3, P4**.
   - Receiver gets **P1, P2, P3**, but **P4 is lost**.
   - Receiver only sends an ACK for **P3** (last correctly received packet).

2. **Round 2**:
   - Sender receives ACK for **P3** but detects that P4 was not acknowledged.
   - **Go Back** and retransmit packets starting from P4:
     - Sender retransmits **P4, P5, P6, P7** (up to the window size).

3. **Round 3**:
   - Receiver now correctly receives all retransmitted packets and sends ACKs for **P4, P5, P6, P7**.

---

### **Selective Repeat Protocol Example**  
**Key Features**:
- Sender can send multiple packets (up to the window size) without waiting for an acknowledgment (ACK) for each one.
- If an error or loss occurs, **only the specific lost or corrupted packet is retransmitted**, not the entire window.

#### Example:
Let’s say:
- **Window size = 4 packets**.
- Sender sends packets: P1, P2, P3, P4.
- Receiver sends acknowledgments (ACKs) back for correctly received packets.

**Scenario**:
1. **Round 1**:
   - Sender sends **P1, P2, P3, P4**.
   - Receiver gets **P1, P3, P4**, but **P2 is corrupted**.
   - Receiver sends:
     - ACK for **P1**.
     - **Negative ACK (NACK)** for **P2** (indicating an error).
     - ACKs for **P3 and P4**.

2. **Round 2**:
   - Sender retransmits **P2** only (not the entire window).
   - Receiver gets **P2** and sends an ACK for it.

3. **Round 3**:
   - Sender moves the window forward and sends **P5, P6, P7, P8**.

### **Comparison of the Two Examples**:
| **Aspect**            | **Go-Back-N Protocol**                          | **Selective Repeat Protocol**                    |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Error Handling**     | Retransmits all packets starting from the error. | Retransmits only the specific erroneous packet. |
| **Efficiency**         | Lower, as more retransmissions are required.    | Higher, as fewer retransmissions occur.         |
| **ACK Mechanism**      | Cumulative ACK (acknowledges all prior packets).| Individual ACK for each packet.                |

---

### **Takeaway**:
- **Go-Back-N**: Simpler but less efficient for noisy channels.
- **Selective Repeat**: More complex but highly efficient for noisy channels.
