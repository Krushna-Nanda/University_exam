Got it! Let me explain in more detail. The **congestion avoidance phase** increases the window size in a controlled, linear way after the threshold is reached, rather than exponentially. Here's how it works step-by-step:

### **Congestion Avoidance in Detail**

1. **What is the window size?**
   - The **window size** is the number of packets a sender can send before waiting for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver. It controls how much data is sent at a time.

2. **What is the threshold?**
   - The **threshold** is a value that helps avoid congestion in the network. It marks the point where the sender switches from sending packets quickly (exponential growth) to sending packets more slowly (linear growth).

3. **How does the window grow?**
   - **Before the threshold**: The window grows **exponentially**, meaning it doubles with each round-trip (ACK received). This is called **slow start**.
   - **After the threshold**: The window grows **linearly**, meaning it increases by **one packet per round-trip** (for all ACKs in one round-trip time).

---

### **Why Linear Growth?**
If the window keeps growing too fast (like doubling all the time), the network might get overloaded and start dropping packets. So, after reaching the threshold, we **slow down** and add one packet at a time to avoid overwhelming the network.

---

### **Example**

Let’s say:
- The **threshold** = 8 packets.
- The **window size** starts at 1 packet.

#### **Before the Threshold (Exponential Growth - Slow Start):**
- Round 1: Send **1 packet**, get ACK → Window size = **2**.
- Round 2: Send **2 packets**, get ACKs → Window size = **4**.
- Round 3: Send **4 packets**, get ACKs → Window size = **8**.
- Now, the window size = **threshold** (8). We switch to **linear growth**.

#### **After the Threshold (Linear Growth - Congestion Avoidance):**
- Round 4: Send **8 packets**, get ACKs → Window size = **9** (increased by 1).
- Round 5: Send **9 packets**, get ACKs → Window size = **10** (increased by 1).
- Round 6: Send **10 packets**, get ACKs → Window size = **11**, and so on.

---

### **How Does It Work in Practice?**
1. Every **round-trip time (RTT)** (time it takes to send packets and get ACKs), the sender increases the window size by **1 packet**.
2. Over time, the window grows slowly but steadily, ensuring that the network remains stable and doesn’t get congested.

---

### **Conclusion**
In congestion avoidance:
- Before the threshold: Window grows **fast** (exponentially).
- After the threshold: Window grows **slowly** (linearly, one packet at a time per RTT).

This way, the sender avoids sending too much data too quickly, preventing packet loss and keeping the network running smoothly!
