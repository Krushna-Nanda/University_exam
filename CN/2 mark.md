Here are concise answers tailored to your **Part-I** questions:

### **Part-I (2 x 10 = 20 Marks)**

**a) Define the term 'protocol' in the context of computer networks.**  
A **protocol** is a set of rules and conventions that govern the communication between devices on a network. It ensures reliable data exchange by defining how data is formatted, transmitted, and received. Examples include HTTP, TCP, and FTP.  

---

**b) Describe the key difference between analog and digital signals.**  
**Analog signals** are continuous waveforms that represent data such as sound, light, or temperature. For example, voice on a telephone is an analog signal.  

**Digital signals** are discrete and use binary (0s and 1s) to represent data. They are commonly used in computers and devices, such as in emails or digital audio recordings.
- **Analog signals** are continuous waveforms representing data, such as sound or light.  
- **Digital signals** are discrete, using binary (0s and 1s) to represent data.  
**Example:** Voice on a telephone (analog), emails (digital).

**c) What is the OSI model, and how does it differ from the TCP/IP model?**  
The **OSI model** is a 7-layer framework (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, etc.) for understanding network functions.  
The **TCP/IP model** has 4 layers (Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access) and focuses on practical implementation.  
**Difference:** OSI is theoretical; TCP/IP is widely used in real-world networking.

---

**d) Explain the concept of 'Layering' in computer networks.**  
**Layering** divides the communication process into separate levels, where each layer handles a specific aspect (e.g., data transfer, addressing).  
- It simplifies network design and troubleshooting.  
- Examples: OSI and TCP/IP models.

**e) List two common transmission impairments in data communication.**  
1. **Attenuation:** Loss of signal strength over distance.  
2. **Noise:** Unwanted signals interfering with the original data (e.g., electromagnetic interference).  

---

**f) What are CRC codes, and what is their purpose in data communication?**  
**Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)** is an error-detection method. It generates a checksum value from data and appends it to the message. The receiver recalculates the checksum to verify data integrity.  

---

**g) Define the term 'multiplexing' in network communication.**  
**Multiplexing** is a technique to combine multiple signals for simultaneous transmission over a single communication channel.  
Types include **TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)** and **FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing).**

---

**h) Describe the purpose of a 'hub' in networking.**  
A **hub** is a simple networking device that connects multiple devices in a LAN. It broadcasts incoming data to all connected devices, leading to higher collisions.

---

**i) What is meant by 'store and forward packet switching'?**  
In **store-and-forward packet switching**, a node receives the entire packet, stores it temporarily, checks for errors, and then forwards it to the next node.  
It ensures error-free data transmission.

---

**j) Explain the term 'sliding window protocol' and its use in networking.**  
The **sliding window protocol** is a flow control mechanism used in reliable data transfer.  
- The sender can send multiple frames before needing an acknowledgment (ACK).  
- It improves efficiency by using a window size for managing unacknowledged frames.
