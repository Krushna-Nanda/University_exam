Here are concise answers tailored to your **Part-I** questions:

### **Part-I (2 x 10 = 20 Marks)**

**a) Define the term 'protocol' in the context of computer networks.**  
A **protocol** is a set of rules and conventions that govern the communication between devices on a network. It ensures reliable data exchange by defining how data is formatted, transmitted, and received. Examples include HTTP, TCP, and FTP.  

---

**b) Describe the key difference between analog and digital signals.**  
**Analog signals** are continuous waveforms that represent data such as sound, light, or temperature. For example, voice on a telephone is an analog signal.  

**Digital signals** are discrete and use binary (0s and 1s) to represent data. They are commonly used in computers and devices, such as in emails or digital audio recordings.
- **Analog signals** are continuous waveforms representing data, such as sound or light.  
- **Digital signals** are discrete, using binary (0s and 1s) to represent data.  
**Example:** Voice on a telephone (analog), emails (digital).

**c) What is the OSI model, and how does it differ from the TCP/IP model?**  
The **OSI model** is a 7-layer framework (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, etc.) for understanding network functions.  
The **TCP/IP model** has 4 layers (Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access) and focuses on practical implementation.  
**Difference:** OSI is theoretical; TCP/IP is widely used in real-world networking.

---

**d) Explain the concept of 'Layering' in computer networks.**  
**Layering** divides the communication process into separate levels, where each layer handles a specific aspect (e.g., data transfer, addressing).  
- It simplifies network design and troubleshooting.  
- Examples: OSI and TCP/IP models.

---

**e) List two common transmission impairments in data communication.**  
1. **Attenuation:** Loss of signal strength over distance.  
2. **Noise:** Unwanted signals interfering with the original data (e.g., electromagnetic interference).  

---

**f) What are CRC codes, and what is their purpose in data communication?**  
**Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)** is an error-detection method. It generates a checksum value from data and appends it to the message. The receiver recalculates the checksum to verify data integrity.  

---

**g) Define the term 'multiplexing' in network communication.**  
**Multiplexing** is a technique to combine multiple signals for simultaneous transmission over a single communication channel.  
Types include **TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)** and **FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing).**

---

**h) Describe the purpose of a 'hub' in networking.**  
A **hub** is a simple networking device that connects multiple devices in a LAN. It broadcasts incoming data to all connected devices, leading to higher collisions.

---

**i) What is meant by 'store and forward packet switching'?**  
In **store-and-forward packet switching**, a node receives the entire packet, stores it temporarily, checks for errors, and then forwards it to the next node.  
It ensures error-free data transmission.

---

**j) Explain the term 'sliding window protocol' and its use in networking.**  
The **sliding window protocol** is a flow control mechanism used in reliable data transfer.  
- The sender can send multiple frames before needing an acknowledgment (ACK).  
- It improves efficiency by using a window size for managing unacknowledged frames.

### Part-I: 2-Mark Questions

(a) **Differentiate between IPv4 and IPv6.**  
**Module IV: Internetworking**  
- IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, allowing approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.  
- IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, providing a vastly larger address space.  
- IPv4 uses dot-decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.0.1), while IPv6 uses hexadecimal separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8::1).  

---

(b) **What is a frame?**  
**Module I: Overview of the Internet**  
A frame is a data packet at the Data Link Layer, encapsulating data for transmission over a physical medium. It includes headers and trailers for synchronization, addressing, and error detection.  

---

(c) **Differentiate between LAN and MAN.**  
**Module I: Overview of the Internet**  
- LAN (Local Area Network): Covers a small area like a home or office, typically using Ethernet.  
- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): Covers a larger area like a city, often using technologies like fiber optics or cable.  

---

(d) **What is the use of a router?**  
**Module III: Connecting Devices**  
A router directs data packets between different networks. It determines the best path for data to travel and connects devices to the internet.  

---

(e) **What is WLAN?**  
**Module II: Data Link Layer**  
WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) is a wireless network that allows devices to connect and communicate using Wi-Fi, eliminating the need for cables.  

---

(f) **Explain the usage of Ethernet.**  
**Module II: Data Link Layer**  
Ethernet is a wired communication standard used for LANs, offering high-speed data transfer and reliable connectivity using cables like CAT5 or CAT6.  

---

(g) **Define the data rate limit.**  
**Module I: Overview of the Internet**  
The data rate limit refers to the maximum amount of data transmitted over a communication channel per second, often determined by the medium's bandwidth and signal quality.  

---

(h) **Explain differences between UDP and TCP.**  
**Module V: Transport Protocols**  
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is connection-oriented, ensuring reliable data delivery.  
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless, faster, but does not guarantee delivery or order.  

---

(i) **Why do we use HTTP?**  
**Module V: Application Layer**  
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is used to transfer web pages and other resources over the internet, enabling communication between clients (browsers) and servers.  

---

(j) **Explain the concept of a periodic analog signal.**  
**Module I: Overview of the Internet**  
A periodic analog signal repeats a pattern over time, such as a sine wave. Examples include radio waves or alternating current (AC) signals.
