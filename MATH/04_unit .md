### **Graph Terminology**

1. **Graph (G)**:  
   A graph is a mathematical structure defined as a pair G = (V, E), where:  
   - **V**: Set of **vertices** (also called nodes).  
   - **E**: Set of **edges** (connections between vertices).

2. **Vertex (v)**:  
   An individual element in the set V.  
   - Example: v1, v2, etc.

3. **Edge (e)**:  
   A connection between two vertices.  
   - Represented as an ordered pair (in a directed graph) or an unordered pair (in an undirected graph).  
   - Example: (v1, v2) or {v1, v2}.

4. **Adjacency**:  
   Two vertices are **adjacent** if they are connected by an edge.  
   - Example: Vertices v1 and v2 are adjacent if there is an edge (v1, v2) or {v1, v2}.

5. **Degree**:  
   The **degree** of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.  
   - Degree of vertex v = Number of edges connected to v.  
   - For **directed graphs**:
     - **In-degree**: Number of edges directed into the vertex.  
     - **Out-degree**: Number of edges directed out of the vertex.

6. **Directed Graph (Digraph)**:  
   A graph where the edges have a direction (ordered pairs).  
   - Example: (v1, v2) indicates an edge from v1 to v2.

7. **Undirected Graph**:  
   A graph where the edges do not have a direction (unordered pairs).  
   - Example: {v1, v2} indicates an edge between v1 and v2, no direction.

8. **Path**:  
   A **path** is a sequence of edges that connects a sequence of vertices, where each vertex is visited only once.  
   - Example: v1 → v2 → v3 is a path.

9. **Cycle**:  
   A **cycle** is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, without repeating other vertices.  
   - Example: v1 → v2 → v3 → v1.

10. **Connected Graph**:  
   A graph is **connected** if there is a path between every pair of vertices.

11. **Complete Graph**:  
   A **complete graph** is a graph where there is an edge between every pair of vertices.  
   - Example: In a complete graph with 3 vertices (K3), the edges are {(v1, v2), (v1, v3), (v2, v3)}.

12. **Null Graph**:  
   A **null graph** is a graph with no edges (E = empty set), but at least one vertex.  
   - Example: V = {v1, v2}, E = empty set.

13. **Singleton Graph**:  
   A graph with exactly one vertex. It may or may not have a self-loop.  
   - Example: V = {v1}, E = empty set or E = {(v1, v1)}.

14. **Subgraph**:  
   A **subgraph** is a graph formed by a subset of the vertices and edges of a larger graph.

15. **Isomorphism**:  
   Two graphs are **isomorphic** if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices and edges, preserving adjacency.

16. **Bipartite Graph**:  
   A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent.

17. **Tree**:  
   A **tree** is a connected acyclic graph.  
   - It has no cycles and is connected.

18. **Spanning Tree**:  
   A **spanning tree** of a graph is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph and is a tree.

19. **Eulerian Path**:  
   A path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once.  
   - A graph has an Eulerian path if it has exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree.

20. **Hamiltonian Path**:  
   A path in a graph that visits every vertex exactly once.

21. **Planar Graph**:  
   A **planar graph** can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing.

22. **Graph Coloring**:  
   **Graph coloring** involves assigning colors to vertices or edges such that adjacent vertices (or edges) have different colors.

23. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**:  
   A shortest-path algorithm that finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.

24. **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**:  
   A problem of finding the shortest possible route that visits every vertex exactly once and returns to the starting point.
