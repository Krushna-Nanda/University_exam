This is still a valid graph because we have a non-empty set of vertices. It’s just a graph with no connections.

Here’s a concise summary of your two questions for your notes:

---

### **1. Can a Graph Exist with an Empty Edge Set?**

- **Answer**: Yes, a graph can exist with an empty edge set. This type of graph is called a **null graph** or **edgeless graph**.
- **Condition**: The **vertex set (V)** must be non-empty.  
- **Example**: \( V = \{1, 2, 3\}, E = \emptyset \) is a valid graph (null graph).
- **Conclusion**: A graph with no edges is still a valid graph if it has at least one vertex.

### **2. What is a Graph with Only One Vertex Called?**

- **Answer**: A graph with only one vertex is called a **singleton graph** or **trivial graph**.
- **Edge Set**: 
  - It can have **no edges**: \( E = \emptyset \).
  - Or a **self-loop**: \( E = \{(v_1, v_1)\} \).
- **Example**: 
  - \( G = (\{v_1\}, \emptyset) \) (no edges).  
  - \( G = (\{v_1\}, \{(v_1, v_1)\}) \) (self-loop).
