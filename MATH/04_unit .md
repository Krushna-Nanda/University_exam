### **Graph Terminology**

1. **Graph (G)**:  
   A graph is a mathematical structure defined as a pair G = (V, E), where:  
   - **V**: Set of **vertices** (also called nodes).  
   - **E**: Set of **edges** (connections between vertices).

2. **Vertex (v)**:  
   An individual element in the set V.  
   - Example: v1, v2, etc.
  
    Isolated Vertex & Pendant Vertex: A vertex having 0 is called an isolated vertex and a vertex having degree 1 is called a pendant vertex.
 Finite and Infinite graph: A graph with a finite number of vertices as well as edges is called a finite graph otherwise it is an infinite graph.

3. **Edge (e)**:  
   A connection between two vertices.  
   - Represented as an ordered pair (in a directed graph) or an unordered pair (in an undirected graph).  
   - Example: (v1, v2) or {v1, v2}.

4. **Adjacency**:  
   Two vertices are adjacent if there is an edge connecting them.  
   - Example: If (v1, v2) is an edge, v1 and v2 are adjacent.  

5. **Degree**:  
   The **degree** of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.  
   - Degree of vertex v = Number of edges connected to v.  
   - For **directed graphs**:
     - **In-degree**: Number of edges directed into the vertex.  
     - **Out-degree**: Number of edges directed out of the vertex.
    
     - The **complement of a graph** is a new graph created by keeping the same vertices as the original graph but adding edges between vertices that were **not connected** in the original graph. Essentially, it has edges where the original graph does not, and vice versa.

6. **Directed Graph (Digraph)**:  
   A graph where the edges have a direction (ordered pairs).  
   - Example: (v1, v2) indicates an edge from v1 to v2.

7. **Undirected Graph**:  
   A graph where the edges do not have a direction (unordered pairs).  
   - Example: {v1, v2} indicates an edge between v1 and v2, no direction.

8. **Path**:  
   A **path** is a sequence of edges that connects a sequence of vertices, where each vertex is visited only once.  
   - Example: v1 → v2 → v3 is a path.

9. **Cycle**:  
   A **cycle** is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, without repeating other vertices.  
   - Example: v1 → v2 → v3 → v1.

10. **Connected Graph**:  
   A graph is **connected** if there is a path between every pair of vertices.

11. **Complete Graph**:  
   A **complete graph** is a graph where there is an edge between every pair of vertices.  
   - Example: In a complete graph with 3 vertices (K3), the edges are {(v1, v2), (v1, v3), (v2, v3)}.

12. **Null Graph**:  
   A **null graph** is a graph with no edges (E = empty set), but at least one vertex.  
   - Example: V = {v1, v2}, E = empty set.

13. **Singleton Graph**:  
   A graph with exactly one vertex. It may or may not have a self-loop.  
   - Example: V = {v1}, E = empty set or E = {(v1, v1)}.

14. **Subgraph**:  
   A **subgraph** is a graph formed by a subset of the vertices and edges of a larger graph.

Here are the simplest definitions of types of graph :

The definitions displayed in the image are:

1.  **Bi-partite graph:** A graph G(V, E) is called a bi-partite graph if its vertex set V(G) can be partitioned into two non-empty disjoint subsets V₁(G) and V₂(G) in such a way that each edge e ∈ E(G) has one end point in V₁(G) and the other end point in V₂(G). The partition V = V₁ ∪ V₂ is called a bipartition of G.

2.  **Complete Bi-partite graph:** A Bi-partite graph G(V, E) is called a Complete bi-partite graph if every vertex in the first partition is connected to every vertex in the second partition, denoted by Kₘ,ₙ.


### **Cycle Graph (Cₙ)**
A **cycle graph** is a graph that consists of a single cycle, where each vertex is connected to exactly two other vertices, forming a closed loop. It has **n** vertices and **n** edges, with each vertex having degree 2.

### **Wheel Graph (Wₙ)**
A **wheel graph** is a graph that consists of a cycle graph with an additional central vertex connected to all other vertices in the cycle. It has **n** vertices: one central vertex, and **n-1** vertices forming a cycle. The central vertex is connected to every other vertex in the cycle, forming a "wheel" shape.

**Weighted Graph**:  
    A graph where each edge has a weight (or cost) associated with it.  
    - Example: (v1, v2, 5) indicates an edge between v1 and v2 with weight 5.  

12. **Simple Graph**:  
    A graph without self-loops or multiple edges between any pair of vertices.  
    - Example: No multiple edges or loops are allowed.  

15. **Disconnected Graph**:  
    A graph where not all vertices are connected by paths. There are disconnected components in the graph.   


19. **Planar Graph**:  
    A graph that can be drawn in a plane without any edges crossing.

    A **regular graph** is a type of graph where **every vertex has the same degree** (i.e., the same number of edges incident to it). 

### **Key Point:**
- In a regular graph, each vertex has the same number of edges connecting it to other vertices.

### **Example:**
- A **3-regular graph** is a graph where every vertex has exactly 3 edges.
- If you have a graph with 5 vertices, and each vertex is connected to exactly 3 other vertices, then it's a 3-regular graph.

### **Types:**
- **k-regular graph:** A graph where every vertex has degree \(k\).
  - Example: In a **4-regular graph**, every vertex connects to exactly 4 other vertices.
 
  - 17. **Bipartite Graph**:  
   A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent.

18. **Tree**:  
   A **tree** is a connected acyclic graph.  
   - It has no cycles and is connected.
"In graph theory, a tree is a connected undirected graph that has no cycles."

18. **Spanning Tree**:  
   A **spanning tree** of a graph is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph and is a tree.

16. In general, two graphs are said to be isomorphic if they are perhaps the same graphs, but just drawn differently with different names. i.e. two graphs are thought of as isomorphic if they have identical behavior in terms of graph-theoretic properties.


22. **Graph Coloring**:  
   **Graph coloring** involves assigning colors to vertices or edges such that adjacent vertices (or edges) have different colors.

# Theorm 

the no of odd degree vertices in a graph is alwasy even 

Yes, it is true that **the number of vertices with an odd degree in any graph is always even**. This is a well-known result in graph theory, often referred to as the **Handshaking Lemma**.

### Why is this the case?
The **Handshaking Lemma** states that:

- The sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is **twice the number of edges**. 
  - This is because each edge contributes 1 to the degree of two vertices, so every edge is counted twice in the total degree sum.

### Formally:
If a graph has **n** vertices and **e** edges, the sum of the degrees of all the vertices is:
\[
\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 2e
\]
This sum is **even**, because it is twice the number of edges.

Now, consider the degrees of the individual vertices:
- If a vertex has an **even degree**, it contributes an even number to the total sum.
- If a vertex has an **odd degree**, it contributes an odd number to the total sum.

For the total degree sum to be **even**, the number of vertices with an odd degree must be even, because the sum of an odd number of odd terms is odd, and the sum of an even number of odd terms is even.

Thus, **the number of vertices with an odd degree must always be even** to ensure the sum is even.

In every case, the number of vertices with an odd degree is always even.

Certainly! Here's the simplified version of your explanation in plain text format, ready for easy copy-pasting into Notepad:

---

**Simple Rule:**
- Even number of odd terms = Even sum
- Odd number of odd terms = Odd sum

**Example:**

1. **2 odd terms:**
   3 + 5 = 8 (even)

2. **3 odd terms:**
   3 + 5 + 7 = 15 (odd)

3. **4 odd terms:**
   1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 (even)

4. **5 odd terms:**
   1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25 (odd)

# ================================================================================================

### **Euler Graph**  
An **Euler graph** is a graph in which there exists an **Eulerian circuit**.  
- An **Eulerian circuit** is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex and **visits every edge exactly once**.  
- For a graph to be an Euler graph, these conditions must be met:  
  1. All vertices in the graph have an **even degree**.  
  2. The graph must be **connected** (all vertices are part of the same component).  

**Example:**  
A square with all four corners connected is an Euler graph because you can traverse each edge exactly once and return to the starting point.  

---

### **Hamiltonian Graph**  
A **Hamiltonian graph** is a graph in which there exists a **Hamiltonian circuit**.  
- A **Hamiltonian circuit** is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex and **visits every vertex exactly once**.  
- There are no simple rules like Euler's, but certain conditions (like Dirac's and Ore's Theorems) help identify Hamiltonian graphs.  

**Example:**  
A pentagon with all corners connected is a Hamiltonian graph because you can visit all vertices exactly once and return to the starting point.

---

### Easy Way to Remember  
- **Euler Graph**: Focuses on **edges** → Visits every **edge** once.  
- **Hamiltonian Graph**: Focuses on **vertices** → Visits every **vertex** once.


# =========================================================================================

No, **Eulerian circuit** and **Eulerian path** are not the same, though they are closely related. Here's the difference:

---

### **Eulerian Circuit**  
- An **Eulerian circuit** is a path that:
  1. Starts and ends at the **same vertex**.
  2. Travels along **every edge exactly once**.

**Conditions for an Eulerian Circuit**:  
- All vertices have an **even degree**.  
- The graph must be **connected** (ignoring isolated vertices).

**Example**: A square with all corners connected can have an Eulerian circuit because you can start and end at the same vertex while traversing all edges exactly once.

---

### **Eulerian Path**  
- An **Eulerian path** is a path that:
  1. **Does not need to start and end at the same vertex**.
  2. Travels along **every edge exactly once**.

**Conditions for an Eulerian Path**:  
- Exactly **0 or 2 vertices** have an **odd degree**.  
- The graph must be **connected** (ignoring isolated vertices).

**Example**: A triangle with one extra edge connecting two vertices can have an Eulerian path but not an Eulerian circuit.

---

### Key Difference:
- **Eulerian Circuit**: Starts and ends at the same vertex.  
- **Eulerian Path**: Does not need to start and end at the same vertex.

If a graph has an Eulerian circuit, it automatically has an Eulerian path.

Got it! Let’s stick strictly to what’s in your syllabus:

### **Trees**  
#### **Tree Traversal**:  
There are two types of tree traversal mentioned in your syllabus:  
1. **Preorder Traversal**  
   - Visit the root node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.  
   - Order: `Root → Left → Right`.

2. **Inorder Traversal**  
   - Visit the left subtree first, then the root node, and finally the right subtree.  
   - Order: `Left → Root → Right`.

3. **Postorder Traversal**  
   - Visit the left subtree first, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.  
   - Order: `Left → Right → Root`.

---

#### **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**:  
A Minimum Spanning Tree is a subset of the edges in a connected graph that:
1. Connects all the vertices.
2. Has the **minimum total edge weight**.
3. Forms a tree (no cycles).

**Algorithms to Find MST**:  
1. **Prim's Algorithm**: Start from any vertex and grow the MST by adding the smallest edge that connects a new vertex.  
2. **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Sort edges by weight and add them to the MST one by one, ensuring no cycles are formed.

Let me know if you want a **step-by-step problem** solved or a focused explanation!

What is a Planar Graph?
A planar graph can be drawn in a plane such that no edges cross each other.

Condition for Planarity (Kuratowski's Theorem):
A graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of either:

K₅ (complete graph on 5 vertices), or
K₃,₃ (complete bipartite graph with 3 vertices in each set).

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's the core mathematical content, removing the extraneous text from the YouTube interface and related videos:

**Theorem:** A connected graph G is Eulerian if and only if all the vertices of G are of even degree.

**Proof:**

**Necessary Condition:**

Assume that G is Eulerian. Then G contains an Eulerian circuit.

Every time we meet an internal vertex (say vᵢ), we traverse two new edges: one edge for entering and another for exiting, without repeating any edges.

Therefore, the degree of each vᵢ = degree(vᵢ) = 2 * (number of times vᵢ occurs in the circuit).

When we start from the initial vertex (say vₛ), we exit through one edge and in the end, we enter the same vertex through another edge.

Therefore, degree(vₛ) = 2.

Thus, all the vertices of G are of even degree.

**Sufficient Condition:**

Assume that all vertices of G are of even degree. Construct an Euler line starting from vertex vₛ. Since every vertex has an even degree, we can enter into every vertex through an edge and exit from the same vertex through another edge. This process continues until we return to vₛ.

This means G has an Eulerian circuit.

Therefore, G is Eulerian.

#            ================================================================

### Theorem: 
The maximum number of edges in a complete graph with \( n \) vertices is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

---

### Proof:

1. **Definition of a Complete Graph**  
   A complete graph, denoted as \( K_n \), is a graph where each vertex is connected to every other vertex. There are no self-loops or parallel edges.

2. **Counting the Number of Edges**  
   In a complete graph with \( n \) vertices:  
   - Each vertex is connected to \( n-1 \) other vertices (it does not connect to itself).  
   - Since the graph is **undirected**, every edge is counted twice if we simply sum the degrees of all vertices.

   Thus, the total number of edges is given by the total number of unique **pairs** of vertices.

3. **Number of Unique Pairs**  
   To compute the total number of unique pairs of vertices, we use the combination formula:  
   \[
   \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
   \]
   This gives the total number of edges in \( K_n \).

4. **Why This is the Maximum**  
   - In a complete graph, every possible edge between vertices exists.  
   - Adding any more edges would require either self-loops or parallel edges, which are not allowed in a simple graph.  
   - Therefore, \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) is the maximum number of edges possible.

---

### Conclusion:
The maximum number of edges in a complete graph with \( n \) vertices is:
\[
\frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]



=======================

To prove that if \( G \) is **minimally connected**, then \( G \) is a **tree**, let us proceed step by step:

---

### Definitions:

1. **Minimally Connected Graph**:  
   A graph \( G \) is minimally connected if it is connected, and removing **any edge** from \( G \) makes it disconnected.

2. **Tree**:  
   A graph \( G \) is a tree if:
   - \( G \) is **connected**, and  
   - \( G \) contains **no cycles** (it is acyclic).

---

### Proof:
We aim to show that a minimally connected graph \( G \) is a tree.

---

#### Step 1: \( G \) is connected.  
By definition of a minimally connected graph, \( G \) is connected. Hence, there is a path between any two vertices in \( G \).

---

#### Step 2: \( G \) is acyclic.  
To prove this, assume that \( G \) contains a cycle. If \( G \) has a cycle, then we can remove any edge from the cycle without disconnecting the graph, because there will still be an alternate path between the vertices of the removed edge (due to the cycle).

This contradicts the assumption that \( G \) is **minimally connected** (removing any edge disconnects \( G \)).  

Hence, \( G \) cannot have a cycle, and \( G \) is **acyclic**.

---

#### Step 3: \( G \) satisfies the definition of a tree.  
From Steps 1 and 2:
- \( G \) is connected (Step 1),
- \( G \) is acyclic (Step 2).

Thus, \( G \) satisfies the definition of a **tree**: a connected, acyclic graph.

---

### Conclusion:
If \( G \) is minimally connected, then \( G \) is a tree.
