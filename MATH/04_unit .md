### **Graph Terminology**

1. **Graph (G)**:  
   A graph is a mathematical structure defined as a pair G = (V, E), where:  
   - **V**: Set of **vertices** (also called nodes).  
   - **E**: Set of **edges** (connections between vertices).

2. **Vertex (v)**:  
   An individual element in the set V.  
   - Example: v1, v2, etc.
  
    Isolated Vertex & Pendant Vertex: A vertex having 0 is called an isolated vertex and a vertex having degree 1 is called a pendant vertex.
 Finite and Infinite graph: A graph with a finite number of vertices as well as edges is called a finite graph otherwise it is an infinite graph.

3. **Edge (e)**:  
   A connection between two vertices.  
   - Represented as an ordered pair (in a directed graph) or an unordered pair (in an undirected graph).  
   - Example: (v1, v2) or {v1, v2}.

4. **Adjacency**:  
   Two vertices are adjacent if there is an edge connecting them.  
   - Example: If (v1, v2) is an edge, v1 and v2 are adjacent.  

5. **Degree**:  
   The **degree** of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.  
   - Degree of vertex v = Number of edges connected to v.  
   - For **directed graphs**:
     - **In-degree**: Number of edges directed into the vertex.  
     - **Out-degree**: Number of edges directed out of the vertex.
    
     - The **complement of a graph** is a new graph created by keeping the same vertices as the original graph but adding edges between vertices that were **not connected** in the original graph. Essentially, it has edges where the original graph does not, and vice versa.

6. **Directed Graph (Digraph)**:  
   A graph where the edges have a direction (ordered pairs).  
   - Example: (v1, v2) indicates an edge from v1 to v2.

7. **Undirected Graph**:  
   A graph where the edges do not have a direction (unordered pairs).  
   - Example: {v1, v2} indicates an edge between v1 and v2, no direction.

8. **Path**:  
   A **path** is a sequence of edges that connects a sequence of vertices, where each vertex is visited only once.  
   - Example: v1 → v2 → v3 is a path.

9. **Cycle**:  
   A **cycle** is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, without repeating other vertices.  
   - Example: v1 → v2 → v3 → v1.

10. **Connected Graph**:  
   A graph is **connected** if there is a path between every pair of vertices.

11. **Complete Graph**:  
   A **complete graph** is a graph where there is an edge between every pair of vertices.  
   - Example: In a complete graph with 3 vertices (K3), the edges are {(v1, v2), (v1, v3), (v2, v3)}.

12. **Null Graph**:  
   A **null graph** is a graph with no edges (E = empty set), but at least one vertex.  
   - Example: V = {v1, v2}, E = empty set.

13. **Singleton Graph**:  
   A graph with exactly one vertex. It may or may not have a self-loop.  
   - Example: V = {v1}, E = empty set or E = {(v1, v1)}.

14. **Subgraph**:  
   A **subgraph** is a graph formed by a subset of the vertices and edges of a larger graph.

Here are the simplest definitions of types of graph :

The definitions displayed in the image are:

1.  **Bi-partite graph:** A graph G(V, E) is called a bi-partite graph if its vertex set V(G) can be partitioned into two non-empty disjoint subsets V₁(G) and V₂(G) in such a way that each edge e ∈ E(G) has one end point in V₁(G) and the other end point in V₂(G). The partition V = V₁ ∪ V₂ is called a bipartition of G.

2.  **Complete Bi-partite graph:** A Bi-partite graph G(V, E) is called a Complete bi-partite graph if every vertex in the first partition is connected to every vertex in the second partition, denoted by Kₘ,ₙ.


### **Cycle Graph (Cₙ)**
A **cycle graph** is a graph that consists of a single cycle, where each vertex is connected to exactly two other vertices, forming a closed loop. It has **n** vertices and **n** edges, with each vertex having degree 2.

### **Wheel Graph (Wₙ)**
A **wheel graph** is a graph that consists of a cycle graph with an additional central vertex connected to all other vertices in the cycle. It has **n** vertices: one central vertex, and **n-1** vertices forming a cycle. The central vertex is connected to every other vertex in the cycle, forming a "wheel" shape.

16. **Isomorphism**:  
   Two graphs are **isomorphic** if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices and edges, preserving adjacency.

17. **Bipartite Graph**:  
   A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent.

18. **Tree**:  
   A **tree** is a connected acyclic graph.  
   - It has no cycles and is connected.

18. **Spanning Tree**:  
   A **spanning tree** of a graph is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph and is a tree.

19. **Eulerian Path**:  
   A path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once.  
   - A graph has an Eulerian path if it has exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree.

20. **Hamiltonian Path**:  
   A path in a graph that visits every vertex exactly once.

21. **Planar Graph**:  
   A **planar graph** can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing.

22. **Graph Coloring**:  
   **Graph coloring** involves assigning colors to vertices or edges such that adjacent vertices (or edges) have different colors.

# Theorm 

the no of odd degree vertices in a graph is alwasy even 

Yes, it is true that **the number of vertices with an odd degree in any graph is always even**. This is a well-known result in graph theory, often referred to as the **Handshaking Lemma**.

### Why is this the case?
The **Handshaking Lemma** states that:

- The sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is **twice the number of edges**. 
  - This is because each edge contributes 1 to the degree of two vertices, so every edge is counted twice in the total degree sum.

### Formally:
If a graph has **n** vertices and **e** edges, the sum of the degrees of all the vertices is:
\[
\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 2e
\]
This sum is **even**, because it is twice the number of edges.

Now, consider the degrees of the individual vertices:
- If a vertex has an **even degree**, it contributes an even number to the total sum.
- If a vertex has an **odd degree**, it contributes an odd number to the total sum.

For the total degree sum to be **even**, the number of vertices with an odd degree must be even, because the sum of an odd number of odd terms is odd, and the sum of an even number of odd terms is even.

Thus, **the number of vertices with an odd degree must always be even** to ensure the sum is even.

In every case, the number of vertices with an odd degree is always even.

Certainly! Here's the simplified version of your explanation in plain text format, ready for easy copy-pasting into Notepad:

---

**Simple Rule:**
- Even number of odd terms = Even sum
- Odd number of odd terms = Odd sum

**Example:**

1. **2 odd terms:**
   3 + 5 = 8 (even)

2. **3 odd terms:**
   3 + 5 + 7 = 15 (odd)

3. **4 odd terms:**
   1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 (even)

4. **5 odd terms:**
   1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25 (odd)

Let’s break this down into simple explanations to help you understand **Graphs**, their **terminology**, **special types of graphs**, and **Bipartite Graphs**.

---

## **1. Graph Terminology**
A **graph** is a collection of points (**vertices**) and connections between them (**edges**). It is denoted as **G = (V, E)** where:
- **V** is the set of vertices (or nodes).
- **E** is the set of edges (connections between vertices).

### Common Terms:
- **Vertex (Node):** A point in the graph. Example: `A`, `B`, `C`.
- **Edge:** A line connecting two vertices. Example: `AB` (edge between `A` and `B`).
- **Adjacent Vertices:** Two vertices connected by an edge. Example: If `AB` is an edge, `A` and `B` are adjacent.
- **Degree of a Vertex:** The number of edges connected to a vertex.
  - **In-degree:** Number of incoming edges (for directed graphs).
  - **Out-degree:** Number of outgoing edges (for directed graphs).
- **Path:** A sequence of vertices where each pair is connected by an edge. Example: `A → B → C`.
- **Cycle:** A path that starts and ends at the same vertex. Example: `A → B → C → A`.
- **Connected Graph:** A graph where there is a path between every pair of vertices.
- **Subgraph:** A smaller graph that is part of a larger graph.

---

## **2. Special Types of Graphs**
Graphs can be categorized based on their properties:

### **Simple Graph**
- No self-loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself).
- No multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.

### **Complete Graph (Kn):**
- Every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.
- A complete graph with `n` vertices has **n(n-1)/2 edges**.

### **Directed Graph (Digraph):**
- Edges have directions, shown with arrows. Example: `A → B`.

### **Weighted Graph:**
- Edges have weights (values), which could represent distances, costs, etc.

### **Cyclic Graph:**
- Contains at least one cycle (a closed path).

### **Acyclic Graph:**
- No cycles exist. Example: Trees are acyclic graphs.

### **Tree:**
- A connected, acyclic graph. Special case: A tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges.

### **Planar Graph:**
- Can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing.

---

## **3. Bipartite Graphs**
A **Bipartite Graph** is a special type of graph where:
- The vertices can be divided into **two disjoint sets**: `U` and `V`.
- Every edge connects a vertex from `U` to a vertex from `V` (no edges exist within the same set).

### **Properties of Bipartite Graphs:**
1. A graph is bipartite if it does not contain an **odd-length cycle**.
2. The vertex sets `U` and `V` are independent (no edges within a set).
3. Bipartite graphs are commonly used in applications like **matching problems** (e.g., assigning jobs to workers).

### **Examples:**
1. A graph with vertices `U = {A, B}`, `V = {C, D}` and edges `{(A, C), (A, D), (B, C)}` is bipartite.
2. A **complete bipartite graph**, denoted as `K(m, n)`, has every vertex in `U` connected to every vertex in `V`.

---

### **Applications of Bipartite Graphs**
1. **Matching Problems:** Assigning tasks to workers.
2. **Scheduling:** Dividing time slots among participants.
3. **Network Flow Problems:** Modeling and optimizing flows in a network.

# ================================================================================================

### **Euler Graph**  
An **Euler graph** is a graph in which there exists an **Eulerian circuit**.  
- An **Eulerian circuit** is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex and **visits every edge exactly once**.  
- For a graph to be an Euler graph, these conditions must be met:  
  1. All vertices in the graph have an **even degree**.  
  2. The graph must be **connected** (all vertices are part of the same component).  

**Example:**  
A square with all four corners connected is an Euler graph because you can traverse each edge exactly once and return to the starting point.  

---

### **Hamiltonian Graph**  
A **Hamiltonian graph** is a graph in which there exists a **Hamiltonian circuit**.  
- A **Hamiltonian circuit** is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex and **visits every vertex exactly once**.  
- There are no simple rules like Euler's, but certain conditions (like Dirac's and Ore's Theorems) help identify Hamiltonian graphs.  

**Example:**  
A pentagon with all corners connected is a Hamiltonian graph because you can visit all vertices exactly once and return to the starting point.

---

### Easy Way to Remember  
- **Euler Graph**: Focuses on **edges** → Visits every **edge** once.  
- **Hamiltonian Graph**: Focuses on **vertices** → Visits every **vertex** once.


# =========================================================================================

No, **Eulerian circuit** and **Eulerian path** are not the same, though they are closely related. Here's the difference:

---

### **Eulerian Circuit**  
- An **Eulerian circuit** is a path that:
  1. Starts and ends at the **same vertex**.
  2. Travels along **every edge exactly once**.

**Conditions for an Eulerian Circuit**:  
- All vertices have an **even degree**.  
- The graph must be **connected** (ignoring isolated vertices).

**Example**: A square with all corners connected can have an Eulerian circuit because you can start and end at the same vertex while traversing all edges exactly once.

---

### **Eulerian Path**  
- An **Eulerian path** is a path that:
  1. **Does not need to start and end at the same vertex**.
  2. Travels along **every edge exactly once**.

**Conditions for an Eulerian Path**:  
- Exactly **0 or 2 vertices** have an **odd degree**.  
- The graph must be **connected** (ignoring isolated vertices).

**Example**: A triangle with one extra edge connecting two vertices can have an Eulerian path but not an Eulerian circuit.

---

### Key Difference:
- **Eulerian Circuit**: Starts and ends at the same vertex.  
- **Eulerian Path**: Does not need to start and end at the same vertex.

If a graph has an Eulerian circuit, it automatically has an Eulerian path.

# ===================================================================================

Got it! Let’s stick strictly to what’s in your syllabus:

### **Trees**  
#### **Tree Traversal**:  
There are two types of tree traversal mentioned in your syllabus:  
1. **Preorder Traversal**  
   - Visit the root node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.  
   - Order: `Root → Left → Right`.

2. **Inorder Traversal**  
   - Visit the left subtree first, then the root node, and finally the right subtree.  
   - Order: `Left → Root → Right`.

3. **Postorder Traversal**  
   - Visit the left subtree first, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.  
   - Order: `Left → Right → Root`.

---

#### **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**:  
A Minimum Spanning Tree is a subset of the edges in a connected graph that:
1. Connects all the vertices.
2. Has the **minimum total edge weight**.
3. Forms a tree (no cycles).

**Algorithms to Find MST**:  
1. **Prim's Algorithm**: Start from any vertex and grow the MST by adding the smallest edge that connects a new vertex.  
2. **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Sort edges by weight and add them to the MST one by one, ensuring no cycles are formed.
